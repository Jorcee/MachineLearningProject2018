It also analyzed the contingent role of both the firm's strategic orientation and its ownership structure. The results demonstrated that it is the combination of a high level of expected contributions coupled with a high level of provided inducements (i.e., organization-focused employment relationship approach) rather than a high level of either expected contributions or provided inducements alone that is critical for firm performance. Further, we found that it is not the organization-focused but the underinvestment employment relationship approach that offers a competitive advantage if the firm pursues the prospector strategy or if the firm is a domestic privately owned enterprise. In particular, the domestic privately owned enterprises reported the highest firm performance when they used the underinvestment approach with their middle managers, in contrast to the state-owned or foreign-invested enterprises. These results support both the universalistic and the contingency perspectives on the relationship between employment relationships and firm performance. They also contribute to our understanding of employment relationships in the global context.

Result: After 12 weeks of treatment, the total efficacy rates of patient/physician global assessment in diacerein and diclofenac groups were 65.4%/61.6% and 61.2%/61.2% respectively (P > 0.05). In the intent-to-treat population, the primary criterion (visual analogue scale [VAS]assessment of pain on walking 20 m) was significantly superior (P < 0.05) to baseline in both two groups. Significant improvement (P < 0.05) was also observed for the secondary criteria, which included tenderness on palpation, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA index (WOMAC) and Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36).

This process is named receptor revision and has been observed in mature peripheral T cells from transgenic mice and human donors. However, whether the receptor revision in mature T cells is a random or orientated process remains poorly understood. Here we used the Jurkat human T cell line, which represents a mature stage of T cell development, as a model to investigate the regulation of T cell receptor (TCR) gene recombination. Methods: TCR DP-J\u03b2 signal joint T cell receptor excision DNA circles (sjTRECs) were determined by nested and seminested PCR. Double-strand DNA breaks at recombination signal sequences (RSSs) in the TCRV\u03b2 chain locus were detected by ligation-mediated-PCR. Further analysis of the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) size of the TCRV\u03b2 chain was examined by the TCR GeneScan technique. Results: RAG1, RAG2, and three crucial components of the nonhomologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) pathway were readily detected in Jurkat. Characteristics of junctional diversity of D\u03b22-J\u03b22 signal joints and ds RSS breaks associated ith the D\u03b22 5\u2032 and D\u03b22 3\u2032 sites were detected in DNA from Jurkat cells. CDR3 size and the gene sequences of the TCRV\u03b2 chain did not change during cell proliferation. Conclusions: RAG1 and RAG2 and ongoing TCR gene recombination are coexpressed in Jurkat cells, but the ongoing recombination process may not play a role in modification of the TCR repertoire.

Results: We have developed a cDNA microarray containing 10250 ESTs to monitor the transcriptional strategy of conidial germination. A total of 1561 genes that had their expression levels specially altered in the process were obtained and hierarchically clustered with respect to their expression profiles. By functional analysis, we provided a global view of an important biological system related to conidial germination, including characterization of the pattern of gene expression at sequential developmental phases, and changes of gene expression profiles corresponding to morphological transitions. We matched the EST sequences to GO terms in the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD). A number of homologues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes related to signalling pathways and some important cellular processes were found to be involved in T. rubrum germination. These genes and signalling pathways may play roles in distinct steps, such as activating conidial germination, maintenance of isotropic growth, establishment of cell polarity and morphological transitions.

METHODS: Caco-2 cells between passages 20 and 30 were cultured with DMEM including 20% fetal bovine serum and 2 mmol/L glutamine for 7 days. Cells were then treated with different concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 (0, 10, and 100 \u03bcg/L) for 24 hours when they became fused.

METHODS: Caco-2 cells were cultured with RPMI 1640 containing 15% fetal bovine serum for 7 days. Cells were then treated with different concentrations of PAF (0, 50, 100 and 200 ng/L) for 24 hours until they became fused. The protective effect of ITF was observed. rITF (0.3 g/L) was treated 30 minutes before (prevention group) and after PAF (treat proup) was given and cells were incubated for 24 hours. MTT was used to detect cell vigor. Epithelial monolayer permeability was measured by trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TER) and mucosal to serosal flux of paracellular marker luminal yellow. RT-PCR was used to detect mRNA expression of ZO-1 and Occludin. Indirect immunofluorescence was used to localize ZO-1 and Occludin. RESULTS: PAF had no effect on the Caco-2's vigor and proliferation. Different concentrations of PAF increased the intestinal epithelial paracellular permeability. TER decreased and luminal yellow flux increased. Treatment and prevention group of rITF partially recovered the increased permeability (122.2 \u00b1 14.7, 100.3 \u00b1 10.9 vs 210.3 \u00b1 26.4, P < 0.05; 10226.1 \u00b1 556.2, 9711.2 \u00b1 364.9 vs 11601.2 \u00b1 693.5, P < 0.05). RT-PCR demonstrated that the mRNA expression of ZO-1 and Occludin in PAF groups treated with different concentrations (especilly 100 ng/L) for 24 hours was significantly different from that in the prevention group (1.07 \u00b1 0.05 vs 1.28 \u00b1 0.06, 0.81 \u00b1 0.06 vs 1.13 \u00b1 0.07, P < 0.05). However, treatment of rITF did not change the expression of mRNA. In the control Caco-2 monolayers, ZO-1 and Occludin proteins were localized at the apical cellular junctions and appeared as continuous belt-like structures encircling the cells at the cellular borders. PAF caused a progressive disturbance in the continuity of ZO-1 and Occludin localization at the cellular borders characterized by zig-zagging appearance at points of multiple cellular contact. rITF could partially recover the disrupted distribution of ZO-1 and Occludin proteins. CONCLUSION: PAF disrupts the intestinal epithelial barrier.

Four hundred American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-II patients, undergoing lumpectomy, were screened and 317 were randomly assigned into one of two groups. In the preemptive tramadol (n = 158) group, patients received an iv injection of tramadol 100 mg 15 min before operation. The preventive group (n = 159) received the same dose of tramadol 15 min before the end of the operation. Pain intensity at rest, overall satisfaction score, morphine consumption and side effects were recorded. A total of 299 patients completed the study. Preemptive and preventive subjects experienced similar analgesic effect and feeling of satisfaction at the first 24 h after surgeries. The similar amount of additional morphine was consumed [4.6 mg (95% CI 1.5-7.2) vs. 4.1 mg (95% CI 1.2-6.3), p=0.811]. No intergroup difference was observed in the incidence of side effects. In conclusion, preemptive and preventive administration of tramadol expressed analgesia of similar efficacy up to 24 h after lumpectomy. The additional morphine requirement, the overall satisfaction and the frequency of side effects all did not display significant difference between the two groups. This implies that the administration of tramadol either before the start or before the end of the surgical procedures all can produce effective postoperative analgesia.

To solve the problems, a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on domain nearest neighbor is proposed. The union of user rating items is used as the basis of similarity computing among users, and the non-target users are differentiated into two types that without recommending ability and with recommending ability. To the former users, user similarity will not be computed for improving real-time performance; to the latter users, \"domain nearest neighbor\" method is proposed and used to predict missing values in the union of user rating items when the users have common intersections of rating item classes with target user, and then the needed items space for missing values predicting can be reduced to the few common intersections.

Methods ANFH was induced by a combination of hypersensitivity vasculitis caused by injection of horse serum and subsequent administration of a high dose of corticosteroid. The pathological changes were detected with digital radiography (DR), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ink artery infusion angiography, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and immunohistochemistry. Results The imageological and pathological changes corresponded to the clinical characteristics of early stage ANFH. DR showed bilaterally increased bone density, an unclear epiphyseal line, and blurred texture of cancellous bone. CT showed spot-like low-density imaging of cancellous bone, thinner cortical bone, osteoporosis, and an unclear epiphyseal line. MRI showed bone marrow edema and spot-like high signals in T2-weighted imaging in cancellous bone. Ink artery infusion angiography showed fewer obstructed blood vessels in the femoral head. HE staining of pathological sections showed fewer trabeculae and thin bone, an increased proportion of empty osteocyte lacunae, decreased hematopoiesis, thrombosis, and fat cell hypertrophy. Immunohistochemistry showed attenuated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in osteoblasts and chondrocytes, and on the inner membrane of blood vessels.

Both Samcri-HMGR and -JHAMT mRNAs were detected in CA almost exclusively. However, their expression patterns were different from each other. During the period of adult emergence, Samcri-HMGR was expressed in CA at a constantly high level suggesting it plays little role for the regulation of JH synthesis. In contrast, the patterns of both Samcri-JHAMT mRNA level and enzyme activity were closely correlated with the patterns of JH synthesis, CA reactivation, and sexual dimorphism of JH synthesis.

The main idea is the dynamic formation of adaptable virtual production lines (called flow paths) corresponding to different product families. The application of different theories of constraints/drum-buffer-rope (TOC/DBR) control policies depends on the differences in scope of variety and scale of demand for these product families. The overall architecture of the proposed mechanism of constraint management-based operation and control is introduced.

An 80% plaque reduction neutralization test was performed to titrate the neutralization antibody before and after viral challenge. Results: We demonstrated that simultaneous administration of pJME plus plasmid-ecoded GM-CSF (pGM-CSF) activated Th1 immune responses similar to those found by injecting pGM-CSF i.m. into mice 3 days before pJME vaccination, and enhancement of Th2 immunity predominated when the pGM-CSF was injected 3 days after pJME vaccination.

The differences of the shear stiffness between white matter(WM) and grey matter(GM) were analyzed by independent sample t test; the differences of brain parenchyma shear stiffness between male and female were estimated by independent sample t test. Spearman test was used to analyze the correlation between age and the shear stiffness of parenchyma; the volunteers were divided into two groups (age \u2264 40 and age > 40) and the correlation between age and shear stiffness of parenchyma in each group were analyzed separately. Results: The shear stiffness of whiter matter [(23.1 \u00b1 5.7) kPa] was higher than that of grey matter [(11.3 \u00b1 2.6) kPa], and the difference was significant (t = 19.34, P < 0.01). In male, the shear stiffness of WM and GM was (23.4 \u00b1 5.8) kPa and (11.4 \u00b1 2.8) kPa respectively; while in female, it was (22. 8 \u00b1 5.6) kPa and (11.1 \u00b1 2.5) kPa respectively. No sex differences were found in the stiffness of white matter or gray matter (t = -0.534, -0.606, P > 0.05).

We have previously reported that natural killer (NK) cells enter target tumor cells, leading to either target cell death or self-destruction within tumor cells. However, it has remained elusive as to the fate of NK cells after internalization and whether the heterotypic cell-in-cell process is different from that of the homotypic cell-in-cell event recently named entosis. Here, we show that NK cells undergo a cell-in-cell process with the ultimate fate of apoptosis within tumor cells and reveal that the internalization process requires the actin cytoskeletal regulator, ezrin. To visualize how NK cells enter into tumor cells, we carried out real-time dual color imaging analyses of NK cell internalization into tumor cells. Surprisingly, most NK cells commit to programmed cell death after their entry into tumor cells, which is distinctively different from entosis observed in the homotypic cell-in-cell process. The apoptotic cell death of the internalized NK cells was evident by activation of caspase 3 and DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, NK cell death after internalization is attenuated by the caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, confirming apoptosis as the mode of NK cell death within tumor cells. To determine protein factors essential for the entry of NK cells into tumor cells, we carried out siRNA-based knockdown analysis and discovered a critical role of ezrin in NK cell internalization. Importantly, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of ezrin promotes the NK cell internalization process. Our findings suggest a novel regulatory mechanism by which ezrin governs NK cell internalization into tumor cells. \u00a9 2009 IBCB, SIBS, CAS.

Methods: Based on the mouse model of local UVB-induced immunosuppression [UVB exposure, followed by sensitization with dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) on the abdomen skin before challenge on the ear site], the PD was applied on the abdomen-irradiated area 1 h, immediately before and 6 h after UVB exposure, respectively.

Conclusion: The ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway plays an important role in the local UVB-induced immunosuppression, and its specific inhibitor PD can arrest its function, resulting in protection against UVB-induced immunosuppression in the present in vivo study. \u00a9 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.", "keywords": ["ERK1/2 MAPK", "Immunosuppression", "PD98059", "Ultraviolet B"], "venue": "Photodermatology Photoimmunology and Photomedicine", "year": 2009, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309cce05"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xia Liu", "org": "Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics"}, {"name": "Shulan Zhang", "org": "Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics"}, {"name": "Qiang Ruan", "org": "Virology Laboratory"}, {"name": "Yaohua Ji", "org": "Virology Laboratory"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Infectious Diseases Laboratory"}, {"name": "Yao Zhang", "org": "Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics"}], "title": "Prevalence and type distribution of human papillomavirus in women with cervical lesions in Liaoning Province, China", "keywords": ["Cervical cancer", "Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia", "HPV GenoArray test", "Human papillomavirus"], "venue": "International Journal of Gynecological Cancer", "year": 2010, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309dd120"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": ""}, {"name": "Mei-Lu Bian", "org": ""}, {"name": "Jiao-Ying Cheng", "org": ""}, {"name": "Wei Xiao", "org": ""}, {"name": "Min Hao", "org": ""}, {"name": "Juan Zhu", "org": ""}, {"name": "Ying Chen", "org": ""}, {"name": "Jun Liu", "org": ""}], "title": "Hybrid capture II for high-risk human papillomavirus DNA testing to detect cervical precancerous lesions: A qualitative and quantitative study", "abstract": "Hybrid capture II (HC-II) is the only technique that can be used in clinical human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detection. However, there is controversy in regards to how to analyze and assess the viral load of high-risk (HR)-HPV by use of HC-II and the relation between viral load and cervical lesions. In this study, we analyzed the results of a sequential screening of outpatients at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, and we aimed to explore the relationship between HR-HPV viral load and the severity of cervical lesions, and to clarify the clinical significance of the titer of HR-HPV DNA determined by HC-II. Using HC-II, 2,761 women were screened for HR-HPV DNA combined with cytological testing using liquid-based cytology. All women with HR-HPV-positive results or abnormalities in cytology underwent a cervical biopsy through colposcopy. Cervical biopsies were taken in 1,051 women. The HR-HPV infection rate was 78.35% (76/97) in HPV-associated lesions, 87.33% (193/221) in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, 94.74% (144/152) in CIN II, 100% (178/178) in CIN III and 100% (20/20) in invasive cervical cancer (ICC), respectively (P<0.05). Based on the criteria of histopathology, the sensitivity of HR-HPV DNA testing by HC-II for detecting high-grade cervical lesions was 97.71%, the specificity was 79.64%, the positive-predictive value was 41.06% and the negative-predictive value was 99.59%.

Further studies demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of ACH on G3PDH is not only confined to epididymal sperm but also to the epididymis. Moreover, little investigation on gene expression changes in the epididymis after ACH treatment has been conducted. Therefore, gene expression studies may indicate new epididymal targets related to sperm maturation and fertility through the analysis of ACH-treated infertile animals.Methods: Rats were treated with ACH for ten consecutive days, and then each male rat copulated with two female rats in proestrus. Then sperm maturation and other fertility parameters were analyzed. Furthermore, we identified epididymal-specific genes that are associated with fertility between control and ACH groups using an Affymetrix Rat 230 2.0 oligo-microarray. Finally, we performed RT-PCR analysis for several differentially expressed genes to validate the alteration in gene expression observed by oligonucleotide microarray.Results: Among all the differentially expressed genes, we analyzed and screened the down-regulated genes associated with metabolism processes, which are considered the major targets of ACH action. Simultaneously, the genes that were up-regulated by chlorohydrin were detected. The genes that negatively regulate sperm maturation and fertility include apoptosis and immune-related genes and have not been reported previously. The overall results of PCR analysis for selected genes were consistent with the array data.Conclusions: In this study, we have described the genome-wide profiles of gene expression in the epididymides of infertile rats induced by ACH, which could become potential epididymal specific targets for male contraception and infertility treatment. \u00a9 2010 Xie et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology", "year": 2010, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309c51f6"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering"}, {"name": "Yi Li", "org": "School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering"}, {"name": "Zusheng Li", "org": "School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering"}], "title": "Frequency-tracking circuit of supersonic power", "abstract": "Supersonic power is used widely in many areas.

Methods: Survivin cDNA sequence was obtained by RT-PCR and inserted into prokaryotic expression vector pET30a(+). Fusion protein of Survivin was expressed in E.coil BL21(DE3). SDS-PAGE and Western blot were used to confirm the fusion protein. The Survivin protein was purified by Ni-NTA agarose affinity chromatography.

Results: The recombinant vector pET30a(+)/Survivin was contracted and the Survivin protein is successfully expressed in E.coil BL21(DE3) as inclusion body. Indirect EILSA was done to detect Survivin autoantibody in these serums using purified Survivin protein. It was shown that the positive rate of Survivin autoantibody was 19.5%, with a specificity of 88.9% in NSCLC patients.

The aim of this study was to establish an epidemiological basis of live births in Julu County, a representative of the northern and mid-western parts of China in terms of demography, disease pattern and women and children's health care infrastructure. Methods The perinatal data of all live births were prospectively collected in three participating county-level hospitals from September 1, 2007 to August 30, 2008. Results There were 5822 live births in these hospitals. Among all live births, 53.7% were male and 4.5% were born prematurely. Mean (SD) birth weight (BW) was (3348\u00b1503) g. The low (<2500 g) and very low BW (<1500 g) infants accounted for 3.8% and 0.5% of the total births, with 6.5% as small for gestational age and 2.8% as multi-births. Cesarean section rate was 30.2%, of which 68.6% were elective. There were 745 infants (12.8% of the live births) admitted to local neonatal wards within 7 days of postnatal life, in which 48.3% and 19.3% were due to perinatal asphyxia and prematurity, respectively. The incidences of perinatal aspiration syndrome, transient tachypnea and respiratory distress syndrome were 4.9%, 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Neonatal mortality was 7.6\u2030 (44/5822), with 16 in delivery room and 28 in neonatal ward before discharge. Conclusions This study provided a population-based perinatal data of live births and neonatal mortality in a northern China county with limited resources.

Various methods of spatial analyses based on the DEM were carried out to delineate these wetland micro-landforms. Primarily, researchers defined micro topography types of mound, depression area and flooding water bank. Secondly, researchers integrated with some spatial analysis methods, including a new improved hydrologic analysis method to extract two geomorphic units as follow: (1) a threshold value of sink filling is defined by the elevation range of the watershed of every sink point.

However, the molecular mechanisms governing directional chemotaxis of leukocytes remain poorly understood. The Slit family of guidance cues has been implicated for inhibition of leuocyte migration. We report that Clara cells in the bronchial epithelium secreted Slit2, whereas eosinophils and neutrophils expressed its cell-surface receptor, Robo1. Compared to neutrophils, eosinophils exhibited a significantly lower level of Slit-Robo GTPase-activating protein 1 (srGAP1), leading to activation of Cdc42, recruitment of PI3K to Robo1, enhancment of eotaxin-induced eosinophil chemotaxis, and exaggeration of allergic airway inflammation. Notably, OVA sensitization elicited a Slit2 gradient at so-called bronchus-alveoli axis, with a higher level of Slit2 in the bronchial epithelium and a lower level in the alveolar tissue. Aerosol administration of rSlit2 accelerated eosinophil infiltration, whereas i.v. administered Slit2 reduced eosinophil deposition. In contrast, Slit2 inactivated Cdc42 and suppressed stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b1-induced chemotaxis of neutrophils for inhibiting endotoxin-induced lung inflammation, which were reversed by blockade of srGAP1 binding to Robo1. These results indicate that the newly identified Slit2 gradient at the bronchus-alveoli axis induces attractive PI3K signaling in eosinophils and repulsive srGAP1 signaling in neutrophils through differential srGAP1 expression during lung inflammation.

However, it is experiencing serious ecological degradation because of human effect. In order to explore measures for ecological improvement, local people and their relationship with ecological environment must be figured out. Taking farmer household as major stakeholder, we intend to derive their household strategies and plans by investigating their attitude and perception and link them with ecological improvement. Local people's attitude and perception to agriculture and agricultural policies were investigated in the Hongqitan Catchment, a typical zone of Chinese agro-pastoral ecotone. The results showed that local people held different attitude and perception to crop production and livestock rearing. Crop production provides them with basic food and income, and most people would like to expand their cropland holding so as to increase their family income. At the same time, they wish to derive more stalks as forage in livestock rearing. However, some people would not like to expand their cropland holding due to limited labor force and low foodstuff price. At present, livestock rearing is the main source of local economic income. Although most people were not satisfied with the number of livestock they possessed, it was hard for them to increase the number of livestock because of the limited forage and grassland. As for agricultural policies, the policy of Grain for Green Project, which was implemented to improve local ecological environment, gained the support of almost all interviewees. However, its sustainability would meet serious challenge after the eight-year of compensation period. In addition, local people were prohibited from browsing in converted woodland, as a result, the contradiction aroused by protection or utilization of converted woodland occurred, which became a tough problem for local governmental management. In the end, the links between local ecological improvement and people's perception were analyzed and some measures for local ecological improvement and sustainable development were put forward and summarized as follows. First, natural laws should be followed in ecological rehabilitation. Grassland ecosystem is more fitting to local physical conditions than agricultural ecosystem, and the latter is one of main reasons for local ecological degradation. So grassland ecosystem should be rebuilt and utilized protectively. Some measures must be done to prevent crop production from expanding and convert it into grassland gradually or change its effect from foodstuff production to fodder production. It is also helpful for local livestock rearing which is given high expectation by local people. Second, local people should be taken as main stakeholder of ecological compensation and conservation during ecological improvement. Or else, they would lose enthusiasm for ecological improvement. On the other hand, local people's economic production should be adapted to not only local ecological environment but also market demands. Third, measures for ecological improvement should not be restricted in local study area. Regional cooperation is necessary for local ecological improvement. For example, urbanization and market-oriented mechanism provide favorable conditions for reducing local population pressure. All in all, the paper could be taken as a pilot study about coupled human and natural systems, and it is helpful for decision-making in ecosystem management.", "keywords": ["Agro-pastoral ecotone", "Coordinating the relationship between crop production and livestock rearing", "Ecological improvement", "Economic demand", "Participatory rural appraisal"], "venue": "Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica", "year": 2010, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309ecc6d"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "School of Management"}, {"name": "Feifei Yue", "org": "School of Management"}], "title": "Industrial clusters' talents agglomeration effects on high-tech enterprises' innovations", "abstract": "This paper analyzes the relationship between industrial clusters' talents agglomeration effects and high-tech enterprises' innovations through exploiting high-tech industry's features and the benefits of clustering mechanism, such as collective innovation channels and knowledge spillover effects, points out that industrial clusters' talents agglomeration effects improve the high-tech enterprises' innovation efficiency and hence promote the enterprises' economic growth and development, and discusses the factors which affect clusters' talents agglomeration effects. \u00a92010 IEEE.", "keywords": ["Collective innovation", "High-tech enterprises", "Industrial clusters", "Knowledge spillover", "Talents agglomeration effects"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on E-Product E-Service and E-Entertainment, ICEEE2010", "year": 2010, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309de926"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhijie Zhao", "org": "Harbin University of Commerce"}, {"name": "Ming Chen", "org": "Harbin University of Commerce"}, {"name": "Long Yang", "org": "Harbin University of Commerce"}, {"name": "Zhipeng Fan", "org": "Harbin University of Commerce"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Harbin University of Commerce"}], "title": "2D to 3D video conversion based on interframe pixel matching", "abstract": "This paper presents a new method for 2D to 3D video conversion based on motion information.

Materials and Methods: An automated image analysis system based on baseline ADC maps was tested against 30 patients with acute ischemic stroke of anterior circulation to predict both infarct core and salvageable ischemic tissue volumes. The predicted infarct core and predicted salvageable ischemic tissue were quantitatively and qualitatively compared with follow-up imaging data in recanalization and no recanalization groups, respectively. Direct comparisons with perfusion- and diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging measures were also made. Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Spearman rank correlation, and Bland-Altman plots were performed. Results: In the recanalization group, the predicted infarct core volume was significantly correlated with the final infarct volume (r = 0. 868, P < .001). In the no recanalization group, the predicted final infarct volume (sum of the predicted infarct core and salvageable ischemic tissue volumes), as well as the predicted salvageable ischemic tissue volume, was also significantly correlated with the true final infarct volume (r = 0.955, P < .001) and infarct growth (r = 0.918, P < .001), respectively. The volumes of perfusion-diffusion mismatch were significantly larger than those of infarct growth and predicted salvageable ischemic tissue. Good agreement between predicted and true final infarct lesions was visualized by Bland-Altman plots in two groups. Direct visual comparative analysis revealed good qualitative agreement between the true final infarct and predicted lesions in 21 patients.

Materials and methods: Chemical composition of hydrodistilled EO obtained from rhizomes of Ligusticum chuanxiong was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The effects of EO on cell viability, apoptosis rate, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase-3 in HSFs were investigated. Results: The experimental results showed that EO significantly inhibited cell viability, elicited morphological changes and induced apoptosis in HSFs. EO also evidently increased the loss of MMP, the levels of LDH release and cellular ROS production, and the activity of caspase-3. Discussion and conclusion: EO-induced apoptosis was at least partially carried out via destruction of the intracellular antioxidant system and elicitation of excessive ROS accumulation in HSFs, which impaired mitochondrial membranes and elicited caspase-3 activation.

However, direct inhibition of PCNA in cancer cells has been difficult due to the lack of targetable sites. We previously reported that phosphorylation of tyrosine 211 (Y211) on PCNA is important for the proliferative function of PCNA when this protein is associated with the chromatin in cancer cells. Here, we show that the Y211 phosphorylation of PCNA is a frequent event in advanced prostate cancer. To explore the potential of this signaling event in inhibition of cancer cell growth, we used a synthetic peptide, the Y211F peptide, which when present inhibits phosphorylation of Y211 on endogenous PCNA. Treatment with this peptide, but not a scrambled control peptide, resulted in S-phase arrest, inhibition of DNA synthesis, and enhanced cell death in a panel of human prostate cancer cell lines. In addition, treatment with the Y211F peptide led to decreased tumor growth in PC3-derived xenograft tumors in vivo in nude mice. Our study shows for the first time that PCNA phosphorylation at Y211 is a frequent and biologically important signaling event in prostate cancer. This study also shows a proof of concept that Y211 phosphorylation of PCNA may be used as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer cells, including cells of advanced cancers that are refractory to standard hormonal therapies. \u00a92011 AACR.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Molecular Cancer Therapeutics", "year": 2011, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309c15d9"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wentao Yue", "org": ""}, {"name": "Xiaoting Zhao", "org": ""}, {"name": "Lina Zhang", "org": ""}, {"name": "Shaofa Xu", "org": ""}, {"name": "Zhidong Liu", "org": ""}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": ""}, {"name": "Wenyun Jia", "org": ""}, {"name": "Zhe Qian", "org": ""}, {"name": "Chunyan Zhang", "org": ""}, {"name": "Yue Wang", "org": ""}, {"name": "Xuehui Yang", "org": ""}], "title": "Cell cycle protein cyclin y is associated with human non-small-cell lung cancer proliferation and tumorigenesis", "abstract": "Background: The role of cell cycle protein cyclin Y (CCNY) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not clear.

Patients and Methods: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used for detecting the expression of CCNY mRNA in 60 samples from patients with NSCLC. The functional role of CCNY in NSCLC cells was evaluated by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of the protein followed by analysis of cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and xenograft growth. Results: CCNY mRNA is overexpressed (N = 60) in samples from patients with NSCLC. Furthermore, CCNY mRNA expression positively correlated with histologic types (squamous cell carcinoma vs. adenocarcinomas; P = .048) and with the tumor size (size > 3 cm vs. size \u2264 3 cm; P = .010) in NSCLC.

RESULTS: The median onset age for patients with AIH and PBC was 51.2 \u00b1 13.4 and 52.8 \u00b1 10.3 years, respectively. Females were more likely to suffer from AIH and PBC than males.

Compared to patients with AIH, those with PBC had much higher levels of TBIL (P < 0.05) which were mainly caused by the increase in DBIL. All patients had decreased levels of ALB, especially those with chronic hepatitis B-related cirrhosis. Patients with AIH and those with PBC had nearly the same positive rate of autoantibodies (63.2% vs 78.3%), while all patients with chronic hepatitis B-related cirrhosis were negative for autoantibodies. Patients with AIH had higher positive rates of ANA and anti-dsDNA but a lower positive rate of AMA than patients with PBC (all P < 0.05).

First, the paper used the cluster analysis methods to divide Chinese 30 provinces into four regions. Then, a panel data model is used to analyze the relationship between agricultural production and it's energy consumption in the different regions. The results show that there are four linkage types between unit energy consumption and unit agricultural output: high growth to high consumption (I), low growth to high consumption (II), low growth to low consumption (III), high growth to low consumption (IV). However, the increase of agricultural output value is not always in coordinate with energy consumption increase in each region. Energy use promoted obviously the agricultural output in region I and IV, but this effect is unconspicuous in region II and III. During the study period of 1990-2007, the increase of energy input has played an important role in Chinese agricultural development. Especially after 1996, the role became more obvious. Meanwhile, the effect appeared earlier in advanced provinces. Finally, according to the above results, some suggestions are put forward as follows: seeking for development on efficiency is final mode of agricultural energy consumption in China; implementing reasonable development plans of agricultural energy use; learning from each other among different regions etc. Based on these work above, it can provide scientific basis for promoting the efficiency of agricultural energy use and healthy development of agriculture in China. \u00a9 2011 IEEE.", "keywords": ["Agriculture", "Cluster analysis", "Energy consumption", "Input", "Output value", "Panel data model", "Region"], "venue": "Proceedings - International Conference on Computer Distributed Control and Intelligent Environmental Monitoring, CDCIEM 2011", "year": 2011, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309dd225"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xin Xiao", "org": "Dept. of Mathematics and Physics"}, {"name": "Jing-Bo Li", "org": "Dept. of Mathematics and Physics"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Spare-time College for Staff and Workers in Beijing Dongcheng District"}], "title": "The model of reliability for a repairable system", "abstract": "In this paper we consider the system of M/M/N queue with service interrup-tions , therates of server breakdown are different between busy time and idle time, and thereis one repairman ite system.

The purpose of this study was to assess the distribution of wall shear stress in advanced carotid plaques using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging and computational fluid dynamics. Methods Eight diseased internal carotid arteries in seven patients were evaluated. High resolution magnetic resonance imaging was used to visualize the plaque structures, and the mechanic stress in the plaque was obtained by combining vascular imaging post-processing with computational fluid dynamics. Results Wall shear stresses in the plaques in all cases were higher than those in control group. Maximal shear stresses in the plaques were observed at the top of plaque hills, as well as the shoulders of the plaques. Among them, the maximal shear stress in the ruptured plaque was observed in the rupture location in three cases and at the shoulder of fibrous cap in two cases. The maximal shear stress was also seen at the region of calcification, in thrombus region and in the thickest region of plaque in the other three cases, respectively.

Methods: Patients with acute cerebral ischemic stroke were retrospectively recruited. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was evaluated at baseline and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at day 90. Favorable outcome was defined as an mRS score of 0 to 2, and unfavorable outcome as 3 to 6. Multimodal stroke magnetic resonance imaging was carried out at presentation. The volumes of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) were measured using the regions of interest (ROI) method. The volumes of predicted infarct core, predicted ischemic penumbra and predicted final infarct were obtained by an automated image analysis system based on baseline ADC maps. The association between baseline magnetic resonance imaging volumes, baseline clinical variables, and functional outcome was statistically analyzed. Results: The study included 30 males and 20 females (mean \u00b1 SD age, 56 \u00b1 10 years). Baseline DWI, PWI and PWI-DWI mismatch volumes were not correlated with day-90 mRS (P > 0.05). Predicted infarct core, predicted ischemic penumbra and predicted final infarct through ADC-based method were all correlated with day-90 mRS (P<0.05). A better outcome was associated with a smaller predicted volume. Low baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and recanalization also demonstrated a trend toward a favorable outcome. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the area under the curve of predicted final infarct volume and recanalization were higher with statistical significance (P < 0.001). Discussion: Predicted volumes obtained from ADC-based methods, especially predicted final infarct volume, as well as baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and recanalization may have effect on functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke. \u00a9 W.

RESULTS: Of 111 eligible publications only 51 (46%) specified the denominators used to calculate survival rates: 6 used all births, 25 used live births, and 20 used neonatal intensive care unit admissions. Overall rates of survival to hospital discharge ranged widely: from 26.5% to 87.8%.

Based on studies which have revealed the tumor-tropic characteristic of neural stem cells (NSCs), we used an immortalized neural stem cell line C17.2 as a cellular therapeutic delivery system to evaluate the antitumor effect of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (HSVtk) on MBs. We first stably transfected the HSVtk gene into C17.2 cells to produce C17.2tk cells, and then mixed C17.2tk with the human MB cell line Daoy at various ratios supplemented with ganciclovir (GCV). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments yielded promising results. Even at a C17.2tk: Daoy ratio as low as 1:16, more than 25% cells were killed in vitro. In vivo co-implantation study showed that when C17.2tk: Daoy ratio was 1:8, tumor growth inhibition was still evident and the mice had significantly prolonged survival. These results might partially be explained by the inherent tumor-tropic properties of NSCs and the bystander effect coupled with expression of connexin-43 (Cx43) between C17.2tk and Daoy cells.

The present review comprises the chemical and pharmacological research on LC in the last decade. Objective: The objective of this review is to bring together most of the scientific research available on LC and evaluate its effects and mechanisms. Methods: The information for 82 cases included in this review was compiled using major databases such as Medline, Elsevier, Springer, Pubmed, and Scholar. Results: The compounds contained in LC can be divided into five kinds, essential oil (EO), alkaloids, phenolic acids, phthalide lactones, and other constituents. A great deal of pharmacological research has been done, which mainly focuses on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular effects, antioxidation, neuroprotection, antifibrosis, antinociception, antiinflammation, and antineoplastic activity. Conclusion: A large number of pharmacological and chemical studies during the last 10 years have demonstrated the vast medicinal potential of LC. It is still very clear that LC is a plant with widespread use now and also with extraordinary potential for the future. The documents strongly support the view that LC has beneficial therapeutic properties and indicates its potential as an effective adaptogenic herbal remedy. \u00a9 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.", "keywords": ["Component", "Plant", "Traditional Chinese medicine", "Umbelliferae"], "venue": "Pharmaceutical Biology", "year": 2011, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309b1a5c"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jianqiang Deng", "org": ""}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": ""}, {"name": "Xiao Feng", "org": ""}], "title": "Work recovery efficiency of work exchange in chemical process", "abstract": "Whenever a high-pressure fluid stream, or simply stream HP, is depressurized, a potential for mechanical energy recovery exists. On the other hand, pressurizing a low-pressure fluid stream, or simply stream LP, always requires mechanical energy. In principle, a work exchanger (WE) may be applied to any high-pressure processing systems where it is also desirable to recover mechanical energy to offset the energy requirement for pressurization of low pressure streams. Because the gas streams in the chemical process often appear with big flux and high pressure, there are great potential to recover work in the process industry. But, it is difficult to forecast and appraise the work recovery result between two gas streams because gas is compressible. For the two kinds of structure of gas-gas WE, the reciprocating machine and the centrifugal machine, their thermodynamic processes were analyzed and the equations of work recovery efficiencies were proposed. The in-depth simplified work recovery efficiency equations of the work transfer process in two WE structures were presented through reasonable assumption and were compared finally. The work recovery efficiency equation of centrifugal machine was also extra influenced by initial volume flow ratio than the reciprocating machine. In order to see what pure influence of the stream phase state on the work recovery efficiency, the influence of initial volume flow ratio was expected to be neglected. So the reciprocating machine was chosen to take as example and its performance of work exchange between two streams with different phase states were compared. Two WE structures corresponded to different work recovery efficiency equations. The simplified work recovery efficiency equation of reciprocating machine followed a power function of compression ratio. Its work recovery efficiency decreased with increasing compression ratio, while for centrifugal structure, the work recovery efficiency was relevant to not only pressure ratio but also initial volume flow ratio. Furthermore, because the centrifugal structure did not involve minimal pressure differential, a centrifugal machine could achieve higher LP compression than a reciprocating machine. The present work compared the work recovery efficiency between the streams with different phase states. The result showed that with the same compression ratio and initial volume flow ratio, liquid-liquid reciprocating work exchanger had the highest work recovery efficiency value. Its ideal value was 100%. The work recovery efficiency values of gas-liquid WE and liquid-gas WE decreased successively, while the value of gas-gas WE was the lowest. The work recovery efficiency equation of centrifugal machine had also extra influence by initial volume flow ratio than the reciprocating machine. \u00a9 All Rights Reserved.", "keywords": ["Centrifugal machine", "Reciprocating machine", "Work exchanger", "Work recovery efficiency"], "venue": "Huagong Xuebao/CIESC Journal", "year": 2011, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309f0936"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Wang", "org": "Institute of High Energy Physics"}, {"name": "Ge Lei", "org": "Institute of High Energy Physics"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Institute of High Energy Physics"}], "title": "EPICS application for interrupt", "abstract": "EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) is a set of software tools, libraries, and applications developed collaboratively by Argonne National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory of America.

Aim: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether vitamin D status and expressions of VDR and LL-37 are involved in the pathogenesis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Methods: Serum and ascitic fluid 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and levels of VDR and LL-37 in peritoneal leukocytes were measured by ELISA and real-time PCR methods in cirrhotic patients with SBP (n = 19) and cirrhotic patients with simple ascites (n = 28). The correlations between these levels and clinical variables were evaluated. Results: Cirrhotic patients with ascites showed low vitamin D concentrations in both serum and ascitic fluid. Lower serum vitamin D concentrations were observed in cirrhotic patients with Child-Pugh C class. 25(OH)D concentrations in ascitic fluid were positive correlated with that in serum (r = 0.74, P < 0.001). The SBP group showed significantly higher levels of both VDR and LL-37 mRNA expressions in peritoneal leukocytes than the simple ascites group (P = 0.005 and P = 0.003, respectively). In the SBP group, VDR and LL-37 expressions in peritoneal leukocytes were positively correlated (r = 0.70, P = 0.001). Conclusions: Vitamin D insufficiency was universal among cirrhotic patients with ascites, and the situation was more severe with more serious cirrhosis. Expressions of peritoneal leukocytes VDR and LL-37 genes were simultaneously up-regulated in cirrhotic patients with SBP when compared with cirrhotic patients with simple ascites. It is indicated that the vitamin D-VDR system and its downstream gene, LL-37, are involved in the pathogenesis and antibacterial immune response to SBP. \u00a9 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.", "keywords": ["Cirrhosis", "LL-37", "Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis", "Vitamin D", "Vitamin D receptor"], "venue": "Digestive Diseases and Sciences", "year": 2012, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309eeb83"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Liang Xie", "org": ""}, {"name": "Chenglong Luo", "org": ""}, {"name": "Chengguang Zhang", "org": ""}, {"name": "Rong Zhang", "org": ""}, {"name": "Jun Tang", "org": ""}, {"name": "Qinghua Nie", "org": ""}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": ""}, {"name": "Xiaoxiang Hu", "org": ""}, {"name": "Ning Li", "org": ""}, {"name": "Yang Da", "org": ""}, {"name": "Xiquan Zhang", "org": ""}], "title": "Genome-wide association study identified a narrow chromosome 1 region associated with chicken growth traits", "abstract": "Chicken growth traits are important economic traits in broilers. A large number of studies are available on finding genetic factors affecting chicken growth.

In the study period from 2004 to 2005, this nationwide study found an incidence of NRF of 13.4% of total admissions to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), with a mortality of 32%. Fewer than 30% of infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) received surfactant treatment. Most cases of NRF had birth weights (BWs) of 1,000-1,500 g. Approximately 60% of deaths were due to withdrawal of respiratory support because of economic restraints despite initial response to therapy. Extremely low BW or gestational age accounted for less than 2% of all NRF cases, and their survival rate was less than 50%. A prospective clinical epidemiologic study of NRF in 14 NICUs, mainly sub-provincial centers, in Hebei province was undertaken in the study period from 2007 to 2008. NRF made up 16.9% of total NICU admissions, with increased use of surfactant (>50%) and continuous positive airway pressure (>80%) in this study. However, mortality due to RDS, meconium aspiration syndrome and pulmonary infection/sepsis remained higher than 30%, in part affected by socioeconomic factors.

In this study we selected four polymorphisms in these genes, several of which have previously been researched, and investigated their association with lung cancer susceptibility and chemotherapy response. Methods: We genotyped the four polymorphisms in a cohort composed of 217 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and 198 controls. Of these, 145 advanced NSCLC patients underwent chemotherapy and were monitored for 5 years. Results: Significant differences in the GSTM1 polymorphism were observed between the case and control groups (P = 0.02). We observed a synergistic effect of smoking and GSTM1. Smokers with deficient-type GSTM1 had a 4.96-fold increased risk of developing lung cancer. Significant differences in GSTM1 and CYP1A1 polymorphisms were observed between the response and nonresponse groups (P = 0.004 and P = 0.026). Moreover, patients with deficient-type GSTM1 were superior responders to platinum drugs than those carrying wild-type GSTM1 (P = 0.014). In addition, patients carrying TT CYP1A1 responded better to nonplatinum drugs than those carrying TC and CC CYP1A1 (P = 0.01). Polymorphisms in the four enzymes had no effect on the overall survival of NSCLC patients. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that a polymorphism in GSTM1 is associated with lung cancer susceptibility. Furthermore, polymorphisms in GSTM1 and CYP1A1 were associated with chemotherapy response. In particular, smokers carrying deficient-type GSTM1 were at a higher risk of developing lung cancer. Patients carrying deficient-type GSTM1 responded better to platinum drugs, while those with TT CYP1A1 were better responders to nonplatinum drugs. \u00a9 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.", "keywords": ["Chemotherapy", "Genetic susceptibility", "Non-small-cell lung cancer", "Polymorphisms"], "venue": "Lung", "year": 2012, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309c1447"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xue Meng", "org": "Department of Radiation Oncology"}, {"name": "Xindong Sun", "org": "Department of Radiation Oncology"}, {"name": "Dianbin Mu", "org": "Department of Pathology"}, {"name": "Ligang Xing", "org": "Department of Radiation Oncology"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Nuclear Medicine"}, {"name": "Baijiang Zhang", "org": "Department of Thoracic Surgery"}, {"name": "Shuqiang Zhao", "org": "Department of Nuclear Medicine"}, {"name": "Guoren Yang", "org": "Department of Nuclear Medicine"}, {"name": "Feng-Ming Kong", "org": "Department of Radiation Oncology"}, {"name": "Jinming Yu", "org": "Department of Radiation Oncology"}], "title": "Noninvasive evaluation of microscopic tumor extensions using standardized uptake value and metabolic tumor volume in non-small-cell lung cancer", "abstract": "Purpose: To prospectively evaluate whether maximal microscopic extensions (MEmax) correlate with maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) at 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) images in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods and Materials: Thirty-nine patients with Stage I-IIIA NSCLC underwent surgery after FDG-PET/CT scanning. SUVmax and MTV were calculated on the PET/CT images. The maximum linear distance from the tumor margin to the farthest extent of the tumor in every dimension was measured at the tumor section. The correlations among MEmax, SUVmax, MTV and other clinical pathologic parameters were analyzed. Results: MEmax for all patients had a significant correlation with SUVmax (r = 0.777, p = 0.008) and MTV (r = 0.724, p < 0.001). When expressed in terms of the probability of covering ME with respect to a given margin, we suggested that margins of 1.93 mm, 3.90 mm, and 9.60 mm for SUVmax \u22645, 5-10, and >10 added to the gross tumor volume would be adequate to cover 95% of ME. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that tumors with high SUVmax and MTV have more MEmax and would therefore require more margin expansion from gross tumor volume to clinical target volume. FDG-PET/CT, especially for SUVmax, is promising and effective and merits additional study in noninvasive delimiting of the clinical target volume margin for NSCLC. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc.", "keywords": ["Clinical target volume margin", "Metabolic tumor volume", "Non-small-cell lung cancer", "Positron emission tomography/computed tomography", "Standardized uptake value"], "venue": "International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics", "year": 2012, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309c3466"}, {"authors": [{"name": "\u00darsula Guill\u00e9n", "org": "Division of Neonatology"}, {"name": "Sara DeMauro", "org": "Division of Neonatology"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Division of Newborn Medicine"}, {"name": "John Zupancic", "org": "Division of Newborn Medicine"}, {"name": "Robin Roberts", "org": "Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics"}, {"name": "Barbara Schmidt", "org": "Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics"}, {"name": "Haresh Kirpalani", "org": "Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics"}], "title": "Relationship between attrition and neurodevelopmental impairment rates in extremely preterm infants at 18 to 24 months: A systematic review", "abstract": "Objective: To assess the effect of loss to follow-up rates at 18 to 24 months on neurodevelopmental outcome statistics for infants of less than 1000 g birth weight or less than 28 weeks' gestational age.

Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, an experimental rabbit model of early stage traumatic ONFH was established, validated, and used for an evaluation of therapy. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging confirmed that this model represents clinical Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) phase I or II ONFH, which was also confirmed by the presence of significant tissue damage in osseous tissue and vasculature. Pathological examination detected obvious self-repair of bone tissue up to 2 weeks after trauma, as indicated by revascularization (marked by CD105) and expression of collagen type I (Col I), osteocalcin, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Transplantation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-transgenic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) 1 week after trauma promoted recovery from ONFH, as evidenced by a reversed pattern of Col I expression compared with animals receiving no therapeutic treatment, as well as increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor. Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate that the transplantation of HGF-transgenic MSCs is a promising method for the treatment for ONFH and suggest that appropriate interference therapy during the tissue self-repair stage contributes to the positive outcomes.

It is the fundamental reason of phenomenon that the decay of quantum efficiency is small at short wavelengths and large at long wavelengths. \u00a9 Chinese Physical Society.", "keywords": ["Emitted electron energy distribution", "GaN photocathode", "Quantum efficiency decay", "Surface potential barrier"], "venue": "Wuli Xuebao/Acta Physica Sinica", "year": 2012, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309c667a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qian Wen", "org": "Institute of Molecular Immunology"}, {"name": "Liang Zhou", "org": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology"}, {"name": "Chaoying Zhou", "org": "Institute of Molecular Immunology"}, {"name": "Mingqian Zhou", "org": "Institute of Molecular Immunology"}, {"name": "Wei Luo", "org": "Institute of Molecular Immunology"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Institute of Molecular Immunology"}], "title": "Change in hepatocyte growth factor concentration promote mesenchymal stem cell-mediated osteogenic regeneration", "keywords": ["Avascular necrosis of femoral head", "Hepatocyte growth factor", "Mesenchymal stem cells", "Osteogenic differentiation", "Proliferation"], "venue": "Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine", "year": 2012, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309ec923"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hong Leng", "org": "Department of Dermatology"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Dermatology"}, {"name": "Xiaoqun Luo", "org": "Department of Dermatology"}, {"name": "Kefei Kang", "org": "Department of Dermatology"}], "title": "Reversal of iC3b-inhibited dendritic cell differentiation via inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase promotes CD4 + T cell proliferation", "abstract": "Objectives: To investigate the roles of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK cascades in the differentiation of iC3b-combined CD14 ", "keywords": ["CD14 + monocyte", "CD4 + T cell", "Dentritic cell", "ERK1/2", "iC3b"], "venue": "Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology", "year": 2012, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309d2aa0"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Hui Zhang", "org": "College of Animal Science and Technology"}, {"name": "Xiaoxiang Hu", "org": "College of Biological Science"}, {"name": "Zhipeng Wang", "org": "College of Animal Science and Technology"}, {"name": "Yuandan Zhang", "org": "Animal Genetics and Breeding Unit"}, {"name": "Shouzhi Wang", "org": "College of Animal Science and Technology"}, {"name": "Ning Wang", "org": "College of Animal Science and Technology"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Animal Science"}, {"name": "Li Leng", "org": "College of Animal Science and Technology"}, {"name": "Shengwen Wang", "org": "Department of Animal Science"}, {"name": "Qigui Wang", "org": "College of Animal Science and Technology"}, {"name": "Yuxiang Wang", "org": "College of Animal Science and Technology"}, {"name": "Zhiquan Tang", "org": "College of Animal Science and Technology"}, {"name": "Ning Li", "org": "College of Biological Science"}, {"name": "Yang Da", "org": "Department of Animal Science"}, {"name": "Hui Li", "org": "College of Animal Science and Technology"}], "title": "Selection signature analysis implicates the PC1/PCSK1 region for chicken abdominal fat content", "abstract": "We conducted a selection signature analysis using the chicken 60k SNP chip in two chicken lines that had been divergently selected for abdominal fat content (AFC) for 11 generations.

Limited literature is available about APC mineralization in the presence of inflammatory cytokines. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) on APC mineralization. Methods: APC cultures were established with the enzymatic dissociation method in vitro. The viability of APCs treated with TNF-\u03b1 was investigated using methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium assays. Cells were then cultured in osteo-/dentinogenic medium with TNF-\u03b1, and mineralization was assessed by alizarin red S staining. Bone sialoprotein (BSP) and dentin sialoprotein (DSP) were analyzed using immunocytochemistry. Mineralization genes such as BSP, dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), osteocalcin (OCN), and dentin matrix acidicphosphoprotein-1 (DMP1) were determined with real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses. Results: The viability of cultured cells was higher with TNF-\u03b1 concentrations of 10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL than with 5 ng/mL or in the control group. Alizarin red S staining showed that APCs had a higher mineralization activity when the osteo-/dentinogenic culture medium contained 10 ng/mL TNF-\u03b1. Immunocytochemical detection showed that the expression of BSP and DSP was positive in APCs after they were induced in osteo-/dentinogenic medium. The expression of mineralization genes differed when treated with 10 ng/mL TNF-\u03b1 (ie, the expression of DSPP mRNA increased on days 7 and 14, whereas the expression of DSPP mRNA decreased on day 21). Conclusions: TNF-\u03b1 may promote APC mineralization in short-term cultures and inhibit the mineralization in long-term cultures. \u00a9 2012 American Association of Endodontists.", "keywords": ["Apical papilla cells", "mineralization", "tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1"], "venue": "Journal of Endodontics", "year": 2012, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309aa01e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qing-Xia Liu", "org": "Ningxia Eye Hospital"}, {"name": "Pei-Feng Liang", "org": "Ningxia Eye Hospital"}, {"name": "Lai-Jun Xu", "org": "Department of Ophthalmology"}, {"name": "Wen-Zhang Du", "org": "Department of Ophthalmology"}, {"name": "Xun-Lun Sheng", "org": "Ningxia Eye Hospital"}, {"name": "Hong-Liang Cao", "org": "Ningxia Eye Hospital"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Graduate School of Ningxia Medical University"}, {"name": "Guang-Hui Yan", "org": "Graduate School of Ningxia Medical University"}, {"name": "Run-Qing Ma", "org": "Graduate School of Ningxia Medical University"}], "title": "Epidemiology research of diabetic retinopathy in Ningxia region", "abstract": "AIM: To know the prevalence, high risk factors of diabetic retinopathy(DR) to provide evidence to the prevention and treatment of DR.

Methods: Subjects were RA patients enrolled in four centers from China, one from Japan and one from the USA, and rheumatologists at those centers. The questionnaires were provided at clinics and patients were asked to list their three top priorities for the rheumatology clinic visit. Physicians were contacted separately and asked to give three general expectations, not for specific visits. We classified clinical expectations into a series of 24 terms for patients and 17 for physicians. We compared physicians' to patients' responses, compared expectations among centers in China, Japan and the USA, and evaluated relationships between patients' responses and age, gender, nationality, disease duration and DAS-28 (Disease Activity Score-28). Results: Patients' clinical expectations for visits focused primarily on control of pain (63.7%), improvement of function (49.3%) and discussion of effects of medication (38.1%). Physicians also included control of pain (59.5%), but also emphasized inquiry about drug side-effects (47.8%) and objective assessment of disease activity (41.4%). We found no differences related to patients' gender, disease duration and DAS-28, but there were some differences related to age and nationality. Conclusion: We found some agreement and some discordance of clinical expectations between RA patients and physicians. There appear to be some different expectations in different countries.

The application of corticosteroid therapy is controversial, whereas recently intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy is emerging as a promising new method. A severity-of-illness score for TEN (SCORTEN) has gained acceptance in some western countries. In this study, our objectives were to assess the applicability of SCORTEN in Chinese patients with TEN and to evaluate the efficacy of the combination therapy of IVIG and corticosteroid in these patients. We performed a retrospective review of data from 61 patients with TEN treated at our intensive care unit from 2000 to 2010 to assess the performance of SCORTEN. In particular, 55 patients between 2002 and 2010 were grouped as a series to compare the therapeutic effects of corticosteroid therapy and IVIG combined therapy contemporaneously. During this period, 16 patients were administered with corticosteroid therapy and 39 were treated with the combination therapy. An initial dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone was given to all TEN patients. The combination therapy was combined with a total dose of 2 g/kg IVIG within 5 days. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic were analyzed to illustrate the performance of SCORTEN. The comparison of the efficacy of the two therapies was conducted on the basis of clinical outcomes, standardized mortality ratio (SMR), and survival analysis. The overall actual mortality of patients between 2000 and 2010 was 16% (10/61), statistically insignificantly lower than predicted (24%, SMR = 67.98). Excellent discriminatory power (the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves: 88.9, 88.2, 90.6%) and good calibration (P = .637, .833, .530) were found in all the groups. In patients admitted between 2002 and 2010, IVIG combined therapy showed a trend toward reducing the mortality rate (13%, SMR = 52.35), whereas corticosteroid monotherapy suggested no such difference (31%, SMR = 123.92). Besides, the cumulative survival rates of the combination therapy were higher at almost all the levels of SCORTEN (P = .002), especially at the score of 5 (P = 3.10 \u00d7 10). Compared with corticosteroid alone, the combination therapy arrested progression earlier (P = .013), although it did not significantly lead to a tapering of corticosteroid or a reduction of the time of hospitalization. We concluded that SCORTEN was generally applicable to Chinese patients with TEN. The comparison of the effect indicated that the combination therapy might achieve a better therapeutic effect than the administration of corticosteroid alone, especially in severe TEN patients. \u00a9 2012 by the American Burn Association.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Journal of Burn Care and Research", "year": 2012, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309e5039"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Bin Zhang", "org": "Departmen of Information Operation and Command Trainning"}, {"name": "Jiangli Yin", "org": "Foundation Department Academy of Equipment"}, {"name": "Xiaofeng Hu", "org": "Departmen of Information Operation and Command Trainning"}, {"name": "Xiaozhi Guo", "org": "Foundation Department Academy of Equipment"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Institute of Postgraduate"}, {"name": "Zhihua Cao", "org": "Institute of Postgraduate"}], "title": "COG modeling and analysis of large scale SoS", "abstract": "According with the perspective of COG, presents a SoS COG Analysis method to solve the problem of large scale SoS capability analysis.

Our previous attempts by compounding MSCs with medical fibrin glue to treat ANFH in animal model have achieved excellent effects. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear, especially on the transgenic gene expression. Methods: Rabbit MSCs were isolated and compounded with fibrin glue. Following degrading of fibrin glue, proliferation, viability, expression of transgenic hepatocyte growth factor gene as well as osteogenic differentiation of MSCs were evaluated together with that of uncompounded MSCs. Fibrin glue-compounded MSCs were transplanted into the lesion of ANFH model, and the therapeutic efficacy was compared with uncompounded MSCs. One-Way ANOVA was used to determine the statistical significance among treatment groups. Results: Fibrin glue compounding will not affect molecular activities of MSCs, including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) secretion, cell proliferation and viability, and osteogenic differentiation in vitro. When applying fibrin glue-compounded MSCs for the therapy of ANFH in vivo, fibrin glue functioned as a drug delivery system and provided a sustaining microenvironment for MSCs which helped the relatively long-term secretion of HGF in the femoral head lesion and resulted in improved therapeutic efficacy when compared with uncompounded MSCs as indicated by hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry of osteocalcin, CD105 and HGF.Conclusion: Transplantation of fibrin glue-compounding MSCs is a promising novel method for ANFH therapy. \u00a9 2014 Wen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "keywords": ["Avascular necrosis of the femoral head", "Differentiation", "Fibrin glue", "Mesenchymal stem cell", "Osteogenic regeneration", "Proliferation"], "venue": "Journal of Translational Medicine", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309cab15"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Physics"}, {"name": "Shiqing Li", "org": "Department of Physics"}, {"name": "Zhiquan Chen", "org": "Department of Physics"}, {"name": "Xingwen Hu", "org": "Department of Physics"}, {"name": "Heping Yan", "org": "Department of Physics"}], "title": "Defect properties in \u03b3 irradiated InP studied by positron annihilation", "abstract": "Three kinds of InP samples (N, P and SI type) with different carrier concentration were irradiated with \u03b3 rays, the doses we used were 0\u223c10", "keywords": ["\u03b3 irradiation", "Charge state", "Defect", "Positron lifetime"], "venue": "Wuhan Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Wuhan University", "year": 1996, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309d34dc"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": ""}], "title": "Mountain pass on a closed convex set", "abstract": "A mountain pass lemma without the Palais-Smale condition on a closed convex subset of a Banach space is established.

There are two major kinds of page segmentation methods, i.e. hierarchical and no-hierarchical ones. Most traditional techniques such as top-down and bottom-up approaches belong to the hierarchical method. Though these two approaches have been used till now, they are not effective for processing documents with high geometric complexity and the process of splitting document needs iterative operations which is time consuming. A non-hierarchical method called the modified fractal signature (MFS) was presented in recent years. It can overcome the above weaknesses, however the MFS needs to calculate modified fractal signature which makes the theory very complex. In this thesis, we present a new page segmentation approach: Median Order Statistic Filter (MedOSF) - Maximum Order Statistic Filter (MaxOSF) approach which is more direct and much simpler. We use the MedOSF to remove the salt-pepper noise of the document and use the MaxOSF to do the page segmentation. In practice, they not only can adaptively process the documents with high geometrical complexity, but also save a lot of computing time.", "keywords": ["Document analysis", "Influence function", "Order statistic filter", "Page segmentation", "Robustness", "Statistic functional"], "venue": "International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence", "year": 2002, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309e9187"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yue Sun", "org": "Department of Chemistry"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Chemistry"}, {"name": "Huai-You Wang", "org": "Department of Chemistry"}, {"name": "Bo Tang", "org": "Department of Chemistry"}], "title": "Determination of Procaine Hydrochloride by Fluorimetry", "abstract": "Use of fluorescence spectrophotometry for the determination of procaine hydrochloride in injection solution of procaine hydrochloride in suggested based on fluorescence property of 4-aminobenzoate which is a hydrolysis product of the procaine hydrochloride in pH 12, with exciatation wavelength and emission wavelength at 268 and 340 nm, respectively.

Unfortunately, with the growth of an enterprise, its information resources are not only heterogeneous but also distributed in physically different systems and databases. How to effectively exploit information across the enterprise is becoming a critical but hard problem. In recent years, metadata which is the detailed description of the data is used to efficiently exploit information resources in the web. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends the resource description framework (RDF) as a standard for the definition and use of metadata descriptions of resources in the web. In this paper, we present an RDF storage and query system called RStar for enterprise resource management. RStar uses a relational database as the persistent data store and defines RStar Query Language (RSQL) for resource retrieval. Currently, most of existing RDF storage and query systems are evaluated on small data sets and no detailed performance analysis is given for such systems. Therefore, we conduct extensive experiments on a large scale data set to investigate the performance problem in RDF storage. Such analysis will be helpful for designing RDF storage and query systems as well as for understanding not well-solved issues in RDF based enterprise resource management. In addition, experiences and lessons learned in our implementation are presented for further research and development.

The segmentation has three sub-procedures: image pyramid formation; linkage adaptation; and unsupervised clustering. These maximise the object recognition capability while ensuring accurate position information. For depth estimation, lower resolution information with a strong correlation to depth is fed into a three-layered neural network as input feature vectors and processed using a Back-Propagation algorithm. The resulting depth model of object recovery is then used with higher resolution data to obtain high accuracy depth measurements.

This method is based on passive ranging by a single sensor and the depth of the sea and other environment parameters are not necessarily known. First the Wigner-Ville distribution is used as the instantaneous frequency estimator to find out the instantaneous frequencies of the multi-lines as a signal. Then define Doppler frequency shift basis functions, based on an algorithm called matching pursuit, by a searching strategy of variable span, and explore the minimum spatial distance between the signal and the Doppler frequency shift basis functions in a five-dimension space. The basis function of the obtained minimum spatial distance corresponds to the estimates of range and speed of the moving vessel. Computer simulations yield statistics errors in the range and speed estimates with differing intensities of noise. If the white noise deviation is less than 10% of the maximum Doppler frequency shift and time-window width is 1.47 times of reference-duration, relative error of range estimation is less than 5.4% and relative error of speed estimates is less than 1.4%. This estimation method has been tested and the result conforms to data collected during an experiment on the sea, the speed is 52 knots and the range is 42 meters.

Here, we propose an ontology model to characterize entities and their relationships in securities domain based on a large number of case studies and industry standards. Securities data, (namely said financial disclosure data, such as annual reports of listed companies), are currently represented in XBRL format and distributed in physically different systems. These data from different sources are firstly collected, populated as the instances of the constructed ontology and stored into an ontology repository. Then, inference is performed to make the relationships between entities explicit for further analysis. Finally, users can pose semantic SPARQL queries on the data to find suspicious business transactions following formal analysis steps.

Methods: The obese and insulin resistance model was induced with high-fat diet in C57BL/6J mice. Twenty-two weeks later the Lee's index (BMI) and the concentrations of blood glucose and plasma insulin were determined. Glucose tolerance test was carried out to verify the appearance of insulin resistance and the impair to glucose tolerance, with normal mice taken as control. Retn mRNA expression in the adipose tissues of model mice (n=10) and control mice (n=5) was detected by Real-time RT-PCR. The resultant resistin protein was co-cultured with mouse skeletal muscle to assess its influence on glucose uptake. Results: An obese and insulin resistance mouse model was successfully induced with high fat diet. The Retn gene expression in adipose tissues was significantly higher in the obese mice than that in normal control mice (P<0.01). The resultant resistin protein had a significant inhibitory effect on the glucose uptake by skeletal muscle with or without insulin (P<0. 05).

The measurement results of the two methods are consistent in free sound field, are different in waveguide. The purpose of this paper is to find out measurement error and its correction, and make the results of the two methods consistent. After defining parameters of a typical waveguide, the transmission functions from sound source to each hydrophone of a vertical array are calculated by wavenumber integration, and then the transmission function of focus beam of vertical array is deduced, finally the measurement errors of the two ways are found. Numerical computation reveals that in the sea of 70 m depth, the measured sound level of a sine signal in different depth varies up 15 dB for single hydrophone measurement, up 7 dB for vertical array measurement. The mean of measurement error of wide band sound level trends to 3 dB for single hydrophone and to 0 dB for vertical array measurement.

In addition, full-length RIP3 induces both caspase-dependent and-independent apoptosis, as well as activates NF-\u03baB. However, after cleavage, the C-terminus of RIP3 (aa 329-518) that lacks the kinase domain can form punctuate or filaments-like structures in cytoplasm, which induces only caspase-dependent apoptosis and exhibits a markedly higher NF-\u03baB-activating activity than full-length RIP3. More importantly, the cleaved product of RIP3 (aa 329-518) displays better stability than wild type RIP3. Additionally, RIP3(K50A), a kinase-dead RIP3 mutant, also induces only caspase-dependent apoptosis along with an increased NF-\u03baB-activating activity compared to RIP3, which further demonstrates that kinase activity of RIP3 is essential for its caspase-independent apoptotic activity.

In the present study, we analyzed the secretory proteins of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea that were predicted by bioinformatics and comparative genomic tools to determine whether the RxLx motif is present in the secretory proteins. In 297 of 1270 secretory proteins, the RxLx motif was detected within a region of 100 amino acids downstream the N-terminal signal peptide cleavage sites. A comparison with the PEDANT database revealed that RxLx motif-containing proteins included enzymes for the degradation of plant cell wall components such as cellulose, endoxylanase, endoglucanase and cutinase hydrolase for degradation of plant cell membrane and cellular contents, this suggests that the RxLx motif-containing proteins probably functioned as virulence proteins and were primarily involved in interaction between the rice blast fungus and host cells. So, our results support the idea that the host -targeting motif (HTM) is a conserved transport machinery, which imply that divergent eukaryotic pathogens might share common mechanisms of pathogenicity. This research will provide useful materials to elucidate whether similar or distinct pathogenic secretion signlals in different eukaryotic pathogens andy can helpful to validate predicted function of the HTM in vivo. \u00a9 2008 IEEE.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "2nd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering, iCBBE 2008", "year": 2008, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309ea031"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Shun Kang", "org": "Key Laboratory of CMCPPE"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Key Laboratory of CMCPPE"}, {"name": "Dang-Hui Chen", "org": "Key Laboratory of CMCPPE"}], "title": "Numerical study of flow structure nearby rectangular cooling holes", "abstract": "In order to have an insight into the flow structure and the mechanism of vortex generation nearby cooling holes, the localized flow structure of rectangular jet holes perpendicular to a flat plate was numerically investigated.

In practical, this hypothesis is not always reasonable. In social network, for example, one people can perform different interests and thus become members of multiple real communities. In this context, we propose a novel algorithm for finding overlapping community structures from a network. This algorithm can be divided into two phases: 1) globally collect proper seeds from which the communities are derived in next step; 2) randomly walk over the network from the seeds by a well designed local optimization process. We conduct the experiments by real-world networks.

In order to fully utilize the well-developed SQL optimization engine, the generated SQL query is desired to be a single statement. (2) SPARQL query aspect. A practical SPARQL query often embeds several filters, which require comparisons between RDF results of different types.

We would partition RDF triples into overlapped groups, store them in a triple table with one more column of group identity, and build up a signature tree to index them. Based on this infrastructure, a complex RDF query is decomposed into multiple pieces of sub-queries which could be easily filtered into some RDF groups using signature tree index, and finally is evaluated with a composed and optimized SQL with specific constraints.

Objective: To observe the difference between injections of 6-OHDA into the striatum from one site and two sites, and to explore the feasibility of establishing Parkinson's disease rat models via striatal one-site double injection. Design, time and setting: A randomized, controlled animal experiment based on a modeling comparison was performed at the Pharmacology Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine between August 2005 and April 2006. Materials: A total of 46 male Wistar rats were purchased from Beijing Weitong Lihua Experimental Animal Technical Co., Ltd., China. 6-OHDA hydrogen bromide was sourced from Sigma Co., Ltd., USA. Methods: All 46 rats were randomized to three groups: one-site injection (n = 18), two-site injection (n = 18), and control (n = 10). Lesions in rat brains were established by infusing 5 \u03bcg 6-OHDA into the striatum at the following coordinates: anteroposterior (AP) 1.0 mm, mediolateral (ML) 2.7 mm, dorsoventral (DV) -5.2 or -6.0 mm for the one-site injection group, and AP 1.0 mm, ML 2.5 mm, DV -4.5 mm/AP -0.4 mm, ML 3.5 mm, DV -4.5 mm for the two-site injection group, respectively. Rats in the control group were injected with the same volume of 0.01% ascorbic acid as above. Main outcome measures: Tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons were detected by immunohistochemistry. Success rates of PD models established by one-site and two-site injection techniques were examined. Results: One rat died in the one-site injection group and four in the two-site injection group.

Further, results from confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis showed that in addition to the reduction of CLDN1 expression, IFN-\u03b3 treatment also led to significant changes in the distribution of CLDN1, CD81, and scavenger receptor class B type I. Moreover, infection assays revealed that IFN-\u03b3-treated cells showed decreased susceptibility to HCVcc infection. These results suggest a novel mechanism that IFN-\u03b3 may inhibit HCV infection by regulating CLDN1 expression and distribution of HCV receptors. \u00a9 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2009.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Journal of Interferon and Cytokine Research", "year": 2009, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309ce84b"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Clinical Nutrition"}, {"name": "Dong-Lian Cai", "org": "Department of Clinical Nutrition"}, {"name": "Huai-Xing Li", "org": "Institute for Nutritional Sciences"}, {"name": "Ben-De Tong", "org": "Department of Clinical Nutrition"}, {"name": "Ying Wang", "org": "Department of Clinical Nutrition"}, {"name": "Su-Ping Pei", "org": "Department of Clinical Nutrition"}], "title": "Protective effects of salidroside on oxidative damage in fatigue mice", "abstract": "Objective: To study the protective effects of salidroside on oxidative damage in fatigue mice. Methods: Thirty-two male Kunming mice were randomly divided into four groups based on body weight: normal control group, salidroside group, training group and salidroside plus training group. The mice in the normal control group and the training group were given distilled water and mice in the salidroside group and the salidroside plus training group were given 180 mg/(kg \u00b7 d) salidroside for 15 days. At 30 min after the last administration, the mice in the training group and the salidroside plus training group were forced to swim for 120 min. Finally, all the mice were killed. The activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase-myocardial band isoenzyme (CK-MB) in plasma were determined by an autobiochemistry analyzer. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathion peroxidase (GSH-Px) and the content of malonaldehyde (MDA) in liver tissue were also detected. The changes of ultrastructures of the skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle were observed under an electron microscope. Results: Compared with no swimming, long-time swimming could significantly increase the activities of LDH, CK and CK-MB in plasma (P<0.05, P<0.01), while salidroside could significantly decrease the activities of CK and CK-MB in plasma induced by long-time swimming (P<0.05, P<0.01). There existed interactions in LDH, CK and CK-MB activities between salidroside and long-time swimming (P<0.05). Compared with no swimming, long-time swimming could significantly decrease the SOD and GSH-Px activities and increase the MDA content in liver tissue (P<0.01). Salidroside could significantly increase the GSH-Px and SOD activities and decrease the MDA content in liver tissue (P<0.05, P<0.01). However, there were no interactions in GSH-Px activity and MDA content between salidroside and long-time swimming (P<0.05). After long-time swimming, more ultrastructural lesions were found in the cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle in the training group than in the salidroside plus training group.

The nonlinear dynamics of the impact system with a frictional slider is analyzed by using the impact Poincar\u00e9 map. The stability and bifurcations of single-impact periodic motions are analyzed, and some information about the existence of other types of periodic-impact motions is provided. Since the system equilibrium is moving downwards, one way to monitor the progression rate is to calculate its progression in a finite time. The simulation results show that in a finite time, the largest progression of the system is found to occur for period-1 multi-impact motions existing in the regions of low forcing frequencies. Secondly, the progression of the period-1 single-impact motion with peak-impact velocity is also distinct enough. However, it is important to note, that the largest progression for period-1 multi-impact motion existing at a low forcing frequency is not an optimal choice for practical engineering applications. The greater the number of the impacts in an excitation period, the more distinct the adverse effects such as high noise levels and wear and tear caused by impacts. As a result, the progression of the period-1 single-impact motion with the peak-impact velocity is still optimal for practical applications.

Characterizing the finger action with the activations of hand muscles could be useful for evaluating the neuromuscular control strategy of finger's motor functions. This study is designed to explore the correlation of isometric fingertip force production and frequency-domain features of surface electromyography (sEMG) recorded on extrinsic hand muscles. To this end, 13 subjects (five male and eight female university students) have been recruited to conduct a target force-tracking task. Each subject is required to produce a certain level of force with either the index or middle fingertip to match the pseudo-random ordered target force level (4N, 6N, or 8N) as accurate as possible. During the finger force production process, the sEMG signals are recorded on two extrinsic hand muscles: flex digitorum superficials (FDS) and extensor digitorum (ED). For each sEMG trail, the power spectrum is estimated with the autoregressive (AR) model and from which the maximum power is obtained. Our experimental results reveal three findings: (1) the maximum power increases with the force level regardless of the force producing finger (i.e. index or middle) and the extrinsic hand muscle (i.e. FDS or ED). (2) The sEMG maximum power of index finger is significantly lower than that of the middle finger under the same force level and extrinsic hand muscle.

In this context, fast query response over such large scaled data would be one of the challenges to existing RDF data stores. In this paper, we propose a novel triple indexing scheme to help RDF query engine fast locate the instances within a small scope. By considering the RDF data as a graph, we would partition the graph into multiple subgraph pieces and store them individually, over which a signature tree would be built up to index the URIs. When a query arrives, the signature tree index is used to fast locate the partitions that might include the matches of the query by its constant URIs. Our experiments indicate that the indexing scheme dramatically reduces the query processing time in most cases because many partitions would be early filtered out and the expensive exact matching is only performed over a quite small scope against the original dataset. \u00a9 2009 IEEE.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Proceedings -

In order to address this challenge, a real-time continuous query model is presented to handle multiple queries with timing constraints. In this model, the execution of one tuple passing through an operator path is modeled as a real-time task instance. A fine-grained scheduling strategy named OP-EDF is proposed for real-time scheduling, which schedules the operator path with the earliest deadline of the waiting tuples at any time slot.

Conventional fractal dimension (FD) is utilized to describe boundary complexity with weaker criminative power. The objective of the paper is to explore new boundary irregularity descriptors at different scales. In the paper, there are two novel measures of boundary's structural irregularities and multiscale features related to boundary roughness are proposed using an integrated quantitative model combining Gaussian filtering and local FDs. There are two key elements in the scheme: (1) Local fractal distributions are taken as a tool to describe local irregularity along boundaries at different scales with meaningful diagnosis features; (2) multi-scaled boundaries generated by Gaussian filters could produce boundary's outlines important to measure of structural irregularity. The advantage of the approach is that feature clusters of boundary irregularity are formed at different scales, so that extracted measurements from multi-scales could provide effective descriptors compared to the conventional FD and other boundary based methods. Experiments show that the proposed irregular descriptors not only enhance finer expressions of boundary complexity but also could effectively discriminate melanomas among moles using statistical features of boundary roughness at different scales. \u00a92009 IEEE.", "keywords": ["Boundary irregularity", "Melanoma", "Multiscale local fractal dimension"], "venue": "3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering, iCBBE 2009", "year": 2009, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309aa6a7"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xin Li", "org": "School of Computer Science and Technology"}, {"name": "Zhiping Jia", "org": "School of Computer Science and Technology"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "College of Computer and Communication Engineering"}, {"name": "Zhiwei Qin", "org": "School of Computer Science and Technology"}, {"name": "Haiyang Wang", "org": "School of Computer Science and Technology"}], "title": "QoS-aware scheduling for mixed real-time queries over data streams", "abstract": "Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) usually need to satisfy multiple QoS requirements of applications, including timing and precision constraints.

At first, a mixed real-time query model is introduced which is composed of periodic, continuous and one-time queries with deadlines. Moreover, an adaptive QoS-aware scheduling strategy, termed FC-TBS, is proposed to schedule these queries using feedback control mechanism. The objective of the FC-TBS strategy is to guarantee the deadlines of periodic queries and minimize the number of deadline violations for aperiodic queries. Besides the system tries to improve the overall query quality by adaptively adjusting CPU utilization factor for aperiodic queries according to workload characteristics and application-defined relationship between sample ratio and QoS.

In this study, the weaning (postnatal day 21, PND21) rats were randomly divided into five groups: the control group (AIN-93G diet, de-ionized water), the lead acetate (PbAC) group (AIN-93G diet, 2. g/L PbAC in de-ionized water), the lead acetate. +.

The protective effects of pre-germinated brown rice (PR) on Pb-induced learning and memory impairment in weaning rats were assessed by the Morris water maze and one-trial-learning passive avoidance test.

To overcome reverberation effects, a method for extracting both geoacoustic parameters and a bottom back-scattering constant from reverberation data was developed. There are many interactions between sound and the sea floor in the process of ocean reverberation. This causes the coupling of geoacoustic and back-scattering parameters to become severe. It is difficult to invert geoacoustic parameters using traditional inversion methods due to this severe coupling. In this paper, relative reverberation levels were used as a first step to eliminate the back-scattering constant. Then sound speed, density and attenuation in sediment were expressed as a function of porosity. Each was separately expressed, and this was based on the Hamilton geoacoustic model. The only unknown parameter (porosity) was easily extracted from relative reverberation data using an adaptive hybrid algorithm. The final step allowed bottom parameters and a bottom back-scattering constant to be deduced using inversed porosity.

In a number of tissues, activation of STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) increases expression of multiple profibrotic genes. Here, we examined the effect of a STAT3 inhibitor, S3I-201, on activation of renal interstitial fibroblasts and progression of renal fibrosis. Treatment of cultured rat renal interstitial fibroblasts with S3I-201 inhibited their activation, as evidenced by dose- and time-dependent blockade of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin expression. In a mouse model of renal interstitial fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction, STAT3 was activated, and administration of S3I-201 attenuated both this activation and extracellular matrix protein deposition following injury. S3I-201 reduced infiltration of the injured kidney by inflammatory cells and suppressed the injury-induced expression of fibronectin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, and collagen type-1 proteins, as well as the expression of multiple cytokines. Furthermore, S3I-201 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis preferentially in renal interstitial fibroblasts of the obstructed kidney. Thus, our results suggest that increased STAT3 activity mediates activation of renal interstitial fibroblasts and the progression of renal fibrosis.

The microstructure analysis showed that the P-MMTs were more exfoliatable than nonpolymerizable MMTs in the preparation of PE/MMTs nanocomposites. By examining the influence of the polymerization condition on the microstructure of the resultant nanocomposites, it was confirmed that the shear force formed by the mechanical stirring was the driving force of the exfoliation dispersion of MMT sheets during the filling polymerization. Comparatively, the shear force on MMT sheets might be increased due to strong interaction between PE chains linked to the surface of P-MMTs and the solvents molecules, which is the reason that polymerizable clay is more exfoliatable than nonpolymerizable clay. The copolymerization between polymerizable modifier and ethylene was confirmed by NMR measurements. Furthermore, the morphology of the resultant nanocomposites was influenced by the concentration of the dispersed PMMTs. The degree of exfoliation of the resultant nanocomposites at a relatively low concentration was higher than that at a high concentration. This is because of the multiscale organization of the organoclay dispersed in the organic medium. High exfoliation degree of MMTs and improved interaction between PE matrix and P-MMTs in PE/P-MMTs nanocomposites led to significant improvements in mechanical properties and barrier properties.

Tissue distribution analysis showed that most of these genes were highly expressed in the fat body implying that the IIS pathway is functionally important within insect adipose tissue. Developmental profile studies revealed that the expression levels of InR, IRS, PI3K110, and PDK were elevated in the fat body during molting and pupation, periods when animals ceased feeding and hemolymph levels of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) were high.

We analyze the parameters used in STDEM model through the simulations, and the effectiveness of model is validated by being applied to a specific distributed data system. \u00a9 2010 IEEE.", "keywords": ["Distributed system", "Trust", "Trust degree", "Trust evaluation"], "venue": "2010 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, ICMLC 2010", "year": 2010, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309e76d0"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Tao Hu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Environment"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Institute of Acoustics"}], "title": "Nonlinear internal wave behavior near the south of Hai-Nan Island and simulating the effect on acoustic propagation", "abstract": "An internal wave observation experiment was performed near the south of Hai-Nan Island in the South China Sea in July 2004.

In a layered medium, frequency dispersion exists and propagation models of interface waves can be researched using mode analysis. For a typical layered structure model, the propagation modes of interface waves can be calculated and the Green's function can be obtained using propagation modes. In practical problems, there are buried objects in the medium. An interface wave scattering integral equation is derived, and scattering interface wave fields can be simulated by computer. For checking this arithmetic, the scattering displacement field can be calculated using the first mode of an interface wave. The convergence rapidity of the method has been proved to be very high by some practical examples, and the scattering strength can be obtained simultaneously. Sometimes, there are multiple objects buried in the medium, and the interface wave scattering integral equation can be spread into calculation of a multi-objects scattering problem by the integral equation of the scattering elastic wave field associated with multi-inhomogeneities. In this paper, the high mode scattering of an interface wave can be calculated also. In order to achieve the detection buried objects using interface wave, there is an experiment for verifying this method. In this experiment, the interface wave signal extraction, propagation velocity, propagation attenuation, and several other aspects are analyzed. The time difference between direct wave and echo wave in the received signal can be obtained according to the geometric relationship of buried objects, source and geophone array locations.

Despite its strong correlation with the metastatic potential of cancer cells, MTA1 can also regulate crucial cellular pathways by modifying the acetylation status. We have previously reported the presence of MTA1/MTA1 in human and mouse testes, providing the evidence for its involvement in the regulation of testicular function during murine spermatogenesis. The objective of present study was to further assess the localization of MTA1 in mouse epididymis on both transcriptional and translational level, and then to explore whether MTA1 expression is regulated by androgens and postnatal epididymal development. Methodology/Principal Findings: Mice were deprived of circulating androgen by bilaterally castration and were then supplemented with exogenous testosterone propionate for one week. MTA1 was immunolocalized in the epithelium of the entire epididymis with the maximal expression in the nuclei of principal cells and of clear cells in proximal region. Its expression decreased gradually after castration, whereas testosterone treatment could restore the expression, indicating that the expression of this gene is dependent on androgen. During postnatal development, the protein expression in the epididymis began to appear from day 7 to day 14, increased dramatically from postnatal day 28, and peaked at adulthood onwards, coinciding with both the well differentiated status of epididymis and the mature levels of circulating androgens. This region- and cell-specific pattern was also conservative in normal human epididymis. Conclusions: Our data suggest that the expression of MTA1 protein could be regulated by androgen pathway and its expression level is closely associated with the postnatal development of the epididymis, giving rise to the possibility that this gene plays a potential role in sperm maturation and fertility. \u00a9 2010 Ma et al.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2010, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309d66e7"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yingzi Ying", "org": "Institute of Acoustics"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Institute of Acoustics"}], "title": "T-matrix formulation of scattering by an obstacle near a planar sediment boundary and application to detection using iterative time reversal", "abstract": "In this paper, the transition matrix (abbreviated to T-matrix) formulation for scattering is adapted to the case of an obstacle immersed in a fluid half-space and in proximity to a planar interface.

Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is usually performed with the patient in the prone position under fluoroscopic guidance; however, this position, and guidance method have some limitations. Methods: From January 2007 to December 2009, 93 patients (101 kidneys) with complex renal calculi underwent ultrasound-guided MPCNL in the flank position. Results: The mean age of the patients was 45.3 years (range 29-71). The calculi-free rate in the patients who underwent a single procedure was 78.2% (79 of 101 kidneys). The average operative duration was 82.6 minutes (range 45-190). Although the perioperative blood loss was not significantly different between single-tract and double-tract MPCNL (P = .087, F = 2.981), the calculi-free rate was significantly greater in the patients who underwent double-tract MPCNL than in those who underwent single-tract MPCNL (P = .027, chi-square = 4.873). Perioperative blood transfusions were not required in any patient. Similarly, ureteral calculi due to percutaneous nephrolithotomy were not observed. Secondary renal hemorrhage occurred in 3 patients who had undergone single-tract MPCNL and 1 underwent nephrectomy. Conclusions: The results of our study have shown that ultrasound-guided MPCNL with the patient in the flank position is safe and effective for treating complex renal calculi, without the side effects of radiation to the patient and surgeon. Double-tract MPCNL is suitable for complex renal calculi and, in some cases, is required to increase the calculi-free rate. The insertion of twin ureteral catheters before lithotripsy might be helpful in avoiding residual ureteral calculi after percutaneous nephrolithotomy. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Urology", "year": 2011, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309ade63"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ping Zhao", "org": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering"}, {"name": "Jin-Wang Huang", "org": "MOE Laboratory of Bioinorganic and Synthetic Chemistry"}, {"name": "Lian-Cai Xu", "org": "Center for Computational Quantum Chemistry"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Chemistry and Chemical Engineering School"}, {"name": "Liang-Nian Ji", "org": "MOE Laboratory of Bioinorganic and Synthetic Chemistry"}], "title": "The photoinduced electron transference of porphyrin-anthraquinone dyads bridged with different lengths of links", "abstract": "The photoinduced electron transference (PET) interaction in porphyrin containing donor-acceptor (D-A) molecules is of great importance in nature and a significant part of the PET research has been devoted to the study of its mechanism (\"through-space\" or \"through-bond\") in these decades.

Overexpression of ezrin contributes to the progression and invasiveness of several human cancers; however, its role in breast cancermetastasis has not been investigated in detail. Methods. Ezrin expression in tissue samples frompatients with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast was detected by immunohistochemistry. Ezrin expression in a breast cancer cell line was evaluated usingWestern blot and RT-PCR. Results. Elevated expression of ezrin was associated with lymph nodemetastasis and poor prognosis in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma. Ezrin expression was related to the invasiveness of breast cancer cells in vitro. Low-dose epirubicin inhibited themigration of breast cancer cells in a concentration-dependentmanner without promoting cytotoxicity in vitro and decreased the expression of ezrin in a concentration- dependent manner.

In this paper, we report that the death domain SXXE/D motifs (i.e., S381DHE motif of TNFR1-death domain as well as S215LKD and S296LAE motifs of TRADD-death domain) are phosphorylated, and this is required for stable TNFR1-TRADD complex formation and subsequent activation of NF-\u03baB. Phospho-S215LKD and phospho-S296LAE motifs are also critical to TRADD for recruiting Fas-associated death domain protein and receptor-interacting protein kinase. I\u03baB kinase \u03b2 plays a critical role in TNFR1 phosphorylation of S381, which leads to subsequent T cell migration and accumulation. Consistently, we observed in inflammatory bowel disease specimens that TNFR1 was constitutively phosphorylated on S381 in those inflammatory T cells, which had accumulated in high numbers in the inflamed mucosa.

Some recent studies shows that prohibitin is overexpressed in cells expressing HCV core proteins, and up-regulated prohibitin is also found in human hepatoma cell line HCC-M, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and other cancers. Prohibitin is an important member of the membrane protein superfamily, and it plays a role of molecular chaperones in mitochondrial protein stability. Meanwhile, it has a permissive action on tumor growth or acts as an oncosuppressor. Based on our previously established the in vitro HCV cell-culture system (HCVcc), here we aimed to investigate the different expression profiles of prohibitin in Huh-7-HCV and Huh-7.5-HCV cells. Methods. The total cellular RNA of Huh-7, Huh-7.5, Huh-7-HCV and Huh-7.5-HCV cells were extracted, and then the first-strand cDNA was reversely transcribed. The expression of prohibitin at the mRNA level was assessed by real-time PCR with GAPDH as the control. Furthermore, the expression of prohibitin at the protein level was evaluated by western blot with GAPDH as an internal control. Results: Our results of real-time PCR showed that the mRNA expression level of prohibitin in Huh-7-HCV cells was 2.09 times higher than that in Huh-7 cells, while, the mRNA level of prohibitin in Huh-7.5-HCV cells was 2.25 times higher than that in Huh-7.5 cells. The results of western blot showed that the protein expression level of prohibitin in Huh-7-HCV cells was 2.38 times higher than that in Huh-7 cells, while the protein expression of prohibitin in Huh-7.5-HCV cells was 2.29 times higher than that in Huh-7.5 cells. Conclusions: The expression of prohibitin was relatively high in Huh-7-HCV and Huh-7.5-HCV cells harboring in vitro transcribed full-length HCV RNA. \u00a9 2011 Dang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "keywords": ["HCVcc", "mRNA level", "prohibitin", "protein level"], "venue": "Virology Journal", "year": 2011, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309b9acd"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ke Wang", "org": "China National Aeronautical Electronic Radio Research Institute"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "School of Electronic, Information and Electrical Engineering"}, {"name": "Wei-Qun Shu", "org": "School of Electronics and Information Engineering"}, {"name": "Tao Xu", "org": "School of Electronics and Information Engineering"}], "title": "Real-time simulation platform for airborne image processing engine", "abstract": "Coped with the trend of digital design of the image processing module in avionics system, a complete real-time simulation platform for airborne image processing was established.

Using large-scale multigeneration screening experiments for recessive lethal or nearly lethal mutations of Drosophila melanogaster and recently developed statistical analysis, we show for male D. melanogaster that (i) mutation rates (for recessive lethal or nearly lethal) are highly variable during germ cell development; (ii) first cell cleavage has the highest mutation rate, which drops substantially in the second cleavage or the next few cleavages; (iii) the intermediate stages, after a few cleavages to right before spermatogenesis, have at least an order of magnitude smaller mutation rate; and (iv) spermatogenesis also harbors a fairly high mutation rate. Because germ-line lineage shares some (early) cell divisions with somatic cell lineage, the first conclusion is readily extended to a somatic cell lineage. It is conceivable that the first conclusion is true for most (if not all) higher organisms, whereas the other three conclusions are widely applicable, although the extent may differ from species to species.

We previously reported that overexpression of exogenous Metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) protects spermatogenic tumor cells GC-2spd (ts) against heat-induced apoptosis. To further dissect the underlying mechanism, we addressed here the fine coordination between MTA1 and p53 in pachytene spermatocytes upon hyperthermal stimulation. Methodology/Principal Findings: High level of MTA1 expression sustained for 1.5 h in primary spermatocytes after heat stress before a notable decrease was detected conversely correlated to the gradual increase of acetylation status of p53 and of p21 level. Knockdown of the endogenous MTA1 in GC-2spd (ts) elevated the acetylation of p53 by diminishing the recruitment of HDAC2 and thereafter led to a dramatic increase of apoptosis after heat treatment. Consistent with this, in vivo interference of MTA1 expression in the testes of C57BL/6 mice also urged an impairment of the differentiation of spermatocytes and a disruption of Sertoli cell function due to the elevated apoptotic rate after heat stress. Finally, attenuated expression of MTA1 of pachytene spermatocytes was observed in arrested testes (at the round spermatid level) of human varicocele patients. Conclusions: These data underscore a transient protective effect of this histone modifier in primary spermatocytes against heat-stress, which may operate as a negative coregulator of p53 in maintenance of apoptotic balance during early phase after hyperthermal stress. \u00a9 2011 Li et al.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2011, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309b5a91"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhen-Bing Tan", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics"}, {"name": "Guang-Tong Liu", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics"}, {"name": "Li L\u00fc", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics"}, {"name": "Chang-Li Yang", "org": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics"}], "title": "Scaling law of quantum Hall plateau-to-plateau transition in single layer graphene", "abstract": "Scaling law of quantum Hall plateau-to-plateau transition in single layer graphene is studied in a temperature range from 2 K to 50 K.

The results showed that adding dithiocarbamates could help forming more long chain branches on PP, and furthermore the chemical structure of the leaving group (R) of dithiocarbamates played a key role in adjusting melt reaction of PP in the presence of peroxide and multifunctional monomer. When the R formed a stable radical (compared to PP macroradicals) after leaving from the dithiocarbamate, such as allyl or benzyl radicals, the presence of dithiocarbamates could reduce the chain scission of PP due to the formation of dormant state species. In this case, the polymerization degree of grafted monomer was also reduced comparing with conventional radical polymerization under the same conditions. Thus more multifunctional monomer could react with PP macroradical to form more branching points and then more uniformly distributed LCB structure on the PP backbone.

Simulation results show that, the proposed method can achieve a better spectrum sensing performance than conventional methods. \u00a9 2012 IEEE.", "keywords": ["cognitive network", "cognitive radio", "information theoretic criteria", "spectrum sensing"], "venue": "2012 2nd International Conference on Consumer Electronics, Communications and Networks, CECNet 2012 - Proceedings", "year": 2012, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309dc87a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yuan Jing", "org": "School of Information"}, {"name": "Xiaofeng Yang", "org": "School of Information"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "School of Information"}, {"name": "Ji Ma", "org": "School of Information"}, {"name": "Bin Niu", "org": "School of Information"}], "title": "Joint multiple CFOs and channel estimation for uplink OFDMA systems without noise statistics", "abstract": "In this paper, an H ", "keywords": ["access (OFDMA)", "carrier frequency offsets", "H \u221e filtering", "intercarrier interference (ICI)", "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"], "venue": "2012 2nd International Conference on Consumer Electronics, Communications and Networks, CECNet 2012 - Proceedings", "year": 2012, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309b2994"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ling-Ling Yang", "org": ""}, {"name": "Ying Huang", "org": ""}, {"name": "Jie Liu", "org": ""}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": ""}, {"name": "Ming-He Mo", "org": ""}, {"name": "Wen-Jun Li", "org": ""}, {"name": "Fa-Xiang Yang", "org": ""}], "title": "Lysinibacillus mangiferahumi sp. nov., a new bacterium producing nematicidal volatiles", "abstract": "A Gram-positive bacterium, designated M-GX18 ", "keywords": ["Lysinibacillus mangiferahumi sp. nov.", "Nematicidal bacteria", "Polyphasic taxonomy", "Volatile"], "venue": "Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, International Journal of General and Molecular Microbiology", "year": 2012, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309cb595"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "School of Computer and Software"}, {"name": "Jie Chen", "org": "School of Computer and Software"}, {"name": "Bo Zhang", "org": "School of Computer and Software"}], "title": "Improved RED algorithm for low-rate DoS attack", "abstract": "Low-rate DoS (LDoS) attack is very ulterior.

The aim of this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is to compare LTME and open total mesorectal excision (OTME) as the primary treatment for patients with middle and low rectal cancer with regard to short-term outcomes. Materials and Methods: Literature searches of electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) and manual searches up to October 30, 2011 were performed. Prospective randomized clinical trials were eligible if they included patients with middle and low rectal cancer treated by LTME versus OTME. Fixed and random effects models were used. Review Manager version 5.1 software was used for pooled estimates. Results: Four RCTs enrolling 624 participants (LTME group, 308 cases; OTME group, 316 cases) were included in the meta-analysis. LTME for rectal cancer was associated with a significantly longer operative time but significantly less intraoperative blood loss and earlier time to pass first flatus. We found no significant differences in the number of lymph nodes, overall morbidity, and perioperative mortality rates between the two groups. Time to resume liquid diet, time to resume normal diet, and length of hospital stay, although not significantly different between the two groups, did suggest a positive trend toward LTME. Conclusions: It may be concluded that LTME is a safe and effective alternative to OTME and is justifiable under the setting of clinical trials. Additional RCTs that compare LTME and OTME and investigate the long-term oncological outcomes of LTME are required to determine the advantages of LTME over OTME. \u00a9 Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Journal of Laparoendoscopic and Advanced Surgical Techniques", "year": 2012, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309ebc0d"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Institute of Information Engineering"}, {"name": "Yanhui Lu", "org": "Institute of Information Engineering"}, {"name": "Peng Zou", "org": "Institute of Information Engineering"}, {"name": "Xiaoping Zhou", "org": "Institute of Information Engineering"}], "title": "Research on indoor electromagnetic radiation field of multiple antenna system", "abstract": "The complexity of the indoor environment brings great challenges to predict the electromagnetic radiation field of multiple antenna systems.

In recent years, to supplying people's the demand, the area of cultivation Salvia was increasing in Hebei province, but the quality was reducing because of non-standard planting and improper use of fertilizer and pesticides. Therefore, it has become the popular areas of researches to improve yield and quality of Salvia at home and abroad. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are a class of beneficial soil microbes. It is well known that AM fungi can enhance the resistance of plants to stressful situations, such as drought, salt, nutrient deficiency, etc. At the same time, AM fungi can form a good symbiotic relationship with the almost ninety percent of vascular plants. Some researches have shown that the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis has significant interactive effects with water and fertilizer. The paper mainly studied the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi(Glomus mosseae) on the growth and nutrient of Salvia miltiorrhiza under different soil water and fertilizer conditions with pot experiment in greenhouse. The experimental design include two water treatments (drought stress, 40% of soil relative water content; normal water, 70% of soil relative water content). The amount of phosphorus included three levels low phosphorus (0. 08 gP/ kg soil,P1), normal phosphorus(0. 16 gP/ kg soil, P2) and high phosphorus (0. 24 gP/ kg soil, P3). The same condition inoculated differently with Glomus mosseae and non- mycorrhizal inoculation. The results showed that the treatment inoculated with AM fungi significantly promoted growth of host plant and infection rate, but the effect sof inoculation were affected by soil water and P level. Under 40% relative water content and different P levels, the inoculation of AM fungi on host plant has different influence on two water levels,Results as follows. The content of tanshinone in root significantly increased under P1, P2, P3 level; Both the content of tanshinone, Ca, Fe in shoot and Zn in root clearly went up only under P1, P2 level; The content of K, Zn in shoot increse only with P3 level; And the Mn in shoot increased only under P2, P3 level; However, when under P1, P2, P3 level, the content of danshensu in shoot and root, total phenolic and total flavonoids in root significantly reduced; Only with P1, P2 level, the total flavonoids in shoot decreased obviously. Under 70% relative water content, inoculation of AM fungi on Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge. has different influence on two water levels as follows. The content of total flavonoids, total phenolic in shoot and root, tanshinone, Fe in shoot and Ca, Mn in shoot all increased under P1, P2, P3 level; The content of danshensu and Zn in root also rised but only under P1, P2 level; The content of Mn in root increased only under P2, P3 level; Cu in shoot, Ca in root and K in shoot significantly increased under P1, P2 and P3 level respectively. The growth of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge. was inhabited by water stress, but the inhibition was alleviated after inoculated with AM fungi. Therefore, AM fungi can form a good symbiotic relationship with Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge.

Therefore, we studied the interactive association of drugs with the IIA subdomain of HSA by fluorescence spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, in order to elucidate the molecular mechanism and behavior of drugs cobinding the IIA subdomain of HSA, and develop a universal structure-based model for HSA carrier design. We solved HSA-fatty acid-cinnamic acid, HSA-fatty acid-cinnamic acid-indometacin and HSA-fatty acid-cinnamic acid-indometacin-lamivudine complex structures, respectively. HSA complex structures and fluorescence quenching of HSA revealed that different drugs can regulate binding sites, binding mode and binding affinity of each other. For example, indometacin renders cinnamic acid to make reposition, and decreases binding affinity of HSA for cinnamic acid, but increases binding affinity of itself to HSA. Lamivudine makes cinnamic acid and indometacin to bind new subsites. Cinnamic acid-indometacin enhances binding affinity of lamivudine, and cinnamic acid-lamivudine increases binding affinity of indometacin, but indometacin-lamivudine decreases binding affinity of cinnamic acid to HSA.

The main aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the safety and efficacy of robotic gastrectomy (RG) and conventional laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) for gastric cancer. Methods: Literature searches of electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library Ovid, and Web of Science databases) and manual searches up to December 30, 2011 were performed. Comparative clinical trials were eligible if they reported perioperative outcomes for RG and LG for gastric cancer. Fixed and random effects models were used. The RevMan 5.1 was used for pooled estimates. Results: Three NRCTs enrolling 918 patients (268 in the RG group and 650 in the LG group) were included in the meta-analysis. RG for gastric cancer was associated with a significantly longer operative time (WMD: 68.77, 95% CI: 35.09-102.45; P < 0.0001), but significantly less intraoperative blood loss (WMD: -41.88, 95% CI: -71.62 to -12.14; P = 0.006). We found no significant differences in the number of lymph nodes (WMD: -0.71, 95% CI: -6.78 to 5.36; P = 0.82), overall morbidity (WMD: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.47 to 1.16; P = 0.19), perioperative mortality rates (WMD: 1.80, 95% CI: 0.30 to 10.89; P = 0.52) and length of hospital stay (WMD: 0.42, 95% CI: -1.87 to 0.79; P = 0.42) between the two groups. Conclusions: It may be concluded that RG is a safe and effective alternative to LG and is justifiable under the setting of clinical trials. Additional RCTs that compare RG and LG and investigate the long-term oncological outcomes are required to determine potential advantages or disadvantages of RG. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

As an important area of vulnerability research, quantitative assessment of vulnerability has raised much focus in academia. Presently, scholars have proposed a variety of methods for quantitative assessment, which usually create an index of overall vulnerability from a suite of indicators, based on the understanding of the cause or mechanism of vulnerability. However, due to the complex nature of vulnerability, this approach caused some arguments on the indicator selection and the weight set for subindices. A data envelopment analysis-based model for the assessment of the regional vulnerability to natural disasters is presented here to improve upon the traditional methods, and a new approach for the classification of vulnerability is proposed. The vulnerability to natural hazards in China's mainland is illustrated as a case study. The result shows that the overall level of vulnerability to natural hazards in mainland China is high. The geographic pattern shows that vulnerability is highest in western China, followed by diminishing vulnerability in central China, and lowest vulnerability levels in eastern China. There is a negative correlation between the level of vulnerability and the level of regional economic development. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.", "keywords": ["Classification", "DEA model", "Natural disasters", "Vulnerability"], "venue": "Natural Hazards", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309e78ca"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Feng Yang", "org": ""}, {"name": "Philbert Lee", "org": ""}, {"name": "Zhiyuan Ma", "org": ""}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": ""}, {"name": "Guoping Yang", "org": ""}, {"name": "Xiaoyang Wu", "org": ""}, {"name": "Hong Liang", "org": ""}], "title": "Regulation of amantadine hydrochloride binding with IIA subdomain of human serum albumin by fatty acid chains", "abstract": "Human serum albumin (HSA) is a major protein component of blood plasma that has been exploited to bind and transport a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous organic compounds. Although anionic drugs readily associate with the IIA subdomain of HSA, most cationic drugs poorly associate with HSA at this subdomain. In this study, we propose to improve the association between cationic drugs and HSA by modifying HSA with fatty acid chains. For our experiments, we tested amantadine hydrochloride, a cationic drug with antiviral and antiparkinsonian effects. Our results suggest that extensive myristoylation of HSA can help stabilize the interaction between amantadine and HSA in vitro. Our X-ray crystallography data further elucidate the structural basis of this regulation. Additionally, our crystallography data suggest that anionic drugs, with a functional carboxylate group, may enhance the association between amantadine and HSA by a mechanism similar to myristoylation. Ultimately, our results provide critical structural insight into this novel association between cationic drugs and the HSA IIA subdomain, raising the tempting possibility to fully exploit the unique binding capacity of HSA's IIA subdomain to achieve simultaneous delivery of anionic and cationic drugs. \u00a9 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "keywords": ["Albumin", "Drug delivery systems", "Fluorescence spectroscopy", "Protein binding", "Structure-transport relationship"], "venue": "Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309bf25f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yaping Qi", "org": "Key Laboratory of Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education"}, {"name": "Lijing Pan", "org": "Key Laboratory of Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Key Laboratory of Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education"}, {"name": "Pan Liao", "org": "Key Laboratory of Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education"}, {"name": "Junxiu Ge", "org": "Key Laboratory of Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education"}, {"name": "Donghua Zhang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education"}, {"name": "Qianqian Zheng", "org": "Key Laboratory of Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education"}, {"name": "Baiwei Yu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education"}, {"name": "Yanxue Tang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education"}, {"name": "Dazhi Sun", "org": "Key Laboratory of Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education"}], "title": "Investigation on FT-IR spectra and dielectric property of PVDF/inorganic composites", "abstract": "In order to explore the effects of ceramics' contents on composites' macro-performance and microscopic structure, polyvinylidene fluoride/barium titanate composites were prepared by a coating technique.

Lesion contours were modeled as signatures with scale normalization to give position and frequency resolution invariance. Energy distributions among different wavelet sub-bands were then analyzed to extract those with significant levels and differences to enable maximum discrimination. Based on the coefficients in the significant sub-bands, structural components from the original contours were modeled, and a set of statistical and geometric irregularity descriptors researched that were applied at each of the significant sub-bands. The effectiveness of the descriptors was measured using the Hausdorff distance between sets of data from melanoma and mole contours.

How to manage P2P traffic efficiently, both to improve the efficiency of network and to protect the interests of P2P users, is widely concerned by industry and academia. Although some traffic planning scheme to the P2P apps such as P4P can alleviate the pressure on bandwidth resources to some extent, it requires deep cooperation between ISPs and P2P service providers. Therefore it has some limitations to independent DPI strategies. In addition, there is no flow planning strategies which can rapidly response to ISPs' QOS requirements such as sudden changes of bandwidth reservation and so on. This paper analyses current mainstream P2P optimization strategies, and then put forward a network resources dynamic allocation (NRDA) technology based on the deployment of P2P traffic stand on the ISPs' position. This technology enables ISPs to have the ability to manage the P2P traffic on the specified links independently and efficiently, especially for the rapid response of unexpected resource requirements. NRDA implements an overall planning of network resources and makes the network flexible, provides the resource planning ability to the ISPs. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.", "keywords": ["Network recourses planning", "P2P", "Traffic planning"], "venue": "Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309e4c9f"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Centre for Analysis and Prediction"}, {"name": "David Vere-Jones", "org": "Inst. of Stat. and Operations Res."}], "title": "Application of M8 and Lin-Lin algorithms to New Zealand earthquake data", "abstract": "This paper describes the application to New Zealand data of two algorithms recently made available through the IASPEI software programme.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered with 5-HT (5 or 10 mg/kg, IP) 30 min prior to the challenge with ethanol (40% v/v, 10 ml/kg, PO). 5-HT dose dependently aggravated ethanol-induced injury in the gastric mucosa. Both xanthine oxidase (XO) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities in the mucosa were significantly increased with the high dose of 5-HT, which also potentiated the elevation of these enzyme activities by ethanol. However, the mucosal superoxide dismutase activity was left unaltered. In neutropenic (antineutrophil serum-treated) animals, the ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury was significantly ameliorated, with or without the pretreatment of 5- HT (10 mg/kg). In addition, the effect of 5-HT on the activity of MPO, but not of XO, was also attenuated in these animals. In the ex vivo gastric chamber study on pentobarbital-anesthetized animals, volume of gastric secretion was significantly decreased in the 5-HT-treated groups, with further reduction after ethanol incubation. Transmucosal potential difference (PD) was significantly reduced in 5-HT-treated rats, which also potentiated the ethanol-induced drop in PD. Nevertheless, 5-HT dose dependently increased mucosal vascular permeability and further enhanced during ethanol incubation. These findings suggest that 5-HT adversely affects the defense mechanisms of the gastric mucosa by reducing the secretory function of the mucosal cells and to weaken the epithelial and vascular integrity. Neutrophil activation appears to be responsible for the detrimental effects of 5-HT partly through the elevation in MPO activity.

Rats were exposed to different concentrations of cigarette smoke (0, 2, and 4%) once daily for a different number of 1 h periods (1, 3, 6, and 9 d). Apoptosis was identified by the terminal deoxy- transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) method and caspase-3 activity. The mucosal xanthine oxidase (XO) activity and p53 level were also measured. The results showed that exposure to cigarette smoke produced a time- and concentration-dependent increase in apoptosis in the rat gastric mucosa that was accompanied by an increase in XO activity. The increased apoptosis and XO activity could be detected after even a single exposure. In contrast, the level of p53 was elevated only in the later stage of cigarette smoke exposure. The apoptotic effect could be blocked by pretreatment with an XO inhibitor (allopurinol, 20 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or a hydroxyl free radical scavenger (DMSO, 0.2%, 1 ml/kg intravenously). However, neither of these treatments had any effect on the p53 level of the mucosa. In summary, we conclude that exposure to cigarette smoke can increase apoptosis in the rat gastric mucosa through a reactive oxygen species- (ROS) mediated and a p53-independent pathway.

Based on the data of the soil moisture and crop yield, the physical basis of subsoiling for water conservation and yield increase was analyzed. The results showed that the soil water storage under subsoiling, from the soil surface to a depth of 100 cm was more than that under no-tillage for the growth season. In the 0-100 cm soil depth, the soil moisture in 50-100 cm depth under subsoiling was more compared with no-tillage, which increased when it's drought and decreased when it's rainy with the increase in soil depth. Compared with no-tillage, subsoiling could reduce the water consumption of oats in the 0-50 cm depth and increase the water consumption in the 50-100 cm depth. Also, subsoiling increased the yield by 18.29% and the water use efficiency by 16.8% in a two-year average. The effects of subsoiling on water conservation and yield increase were affected by precipitation, and a well-proportioned rainfall was better to increase yield and water use efficiency.

In this paper, a fuzzy set theory based method for building optimal bidding strategies is presented for generation companies participating in a recently established electricity market in which the widely-used step-wise bidding protocol is utilized and the available historical data is not sufficient. Taken into account of the insufficient history data especially bidding data, bidding behaviors of rival generation companies are modeled as fuzzy sets and a bidding strategy optimization model is then developed. The well-known genetic algorithm is next employed to solve the bidding strategy optimization problem.

This study was designed to investigate the response of distraction callus to continuous distraction at a rapid rate using a rabbit model of mandibular lengthening. METHODS: Thirty adult New Zealand white rabbits were randomly assigned to the intermittent (1 step/d) or continuous distraction (8 steps/s) group, with 15 in each. After osteotomy, manual-driven or autodriven distractor was adapted accordingly. The distraction was activated at a rate of 3.0 mm/d for 4 days. Five rabbits in each group were killed at week 2, week 4, and week 12 of consolidation, respectively. Plain radiography, microcomputed tomography, and histology examinations were used to evaluate the bone regeneration status. RESULTS: Plain radiographs and histologic studies demonstrated more advanced bone healing in continuous distraction group than that in intermittent distraction group at all the examined time points. Quantitative microcomputed tomography analysis showed significantly higher bone volume in continuous distraction group at week 2 (p < 0.01) and week 4 (p < 0.05) of consolidation. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous traction by autodriven distractor could be a promising clinical alternative to shorten the treatment course of distraction osteogenesis. Further studies to test its clinical potential using large animals that have similar metabolic rate and muscular resistance with human being are necessary.

The aims of this study were to compare the clinical outcomes of single mandibular implant-retained overdentures versus that of complete dentures. Materials and methods: Thirteen edentulous patients with a mean age of 71 years were enrolled in this investigation. They were treated with a single implant inserted into the mandibular midline, followed by rehabilitation with complete dentures. The mandibular dentures were adhered with a locator or magnetic attachment after 10 weeks of adaptation. Patient satisfaction was assessed by means of a visual analogue scale(VAS) questionnaire both on the day of attachment connection and 3 months later. Chewing efficiency was assessed by a sieve test before and after connecting the attachment. Within-subject comparisons were performed either by using paired-sample t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to test patient satisfaction and chewing efficiency (P = 0.05). Results: No implants were lost nor were denture fracture found during the observation period. Significant improvements were observed in all parameters of patient satisfaction (with P values ranging from <0.001 to \u223c0.043) after attachment of the mandibular dentures with a single midline implant. Furthermore, the objective chewing efficiency of patients significantly improved after implant connection (P<0.001). Conclusion: Within the limitations of this preliminary prospective clinical study, singleimplant-supported mandibular overdentures were a successful alternative treatment option for elderly edentulous patients.

The experiment contains two stages. In the first stage, two vessels were tested using 10g and 20g explosive charge, respectively. Dynamic circumferential and axial strain was measured. The vessel under the blast of 10g explosive was in good condition while the other one was failure as a through crack appeared.

Fatigue is an important concern in these pressure vessels, which are subjected to alternative loads. Even though several codes and standards have guidelines on these pressure vessels, there are no relevant design methods on fatigue failure. To understand the fatigue properties of ASS 1.4301 (equivalents include UNS S30400 and AISI 304) in solution-annealed (SA) and cold-stretched conditions (9% strain level) and the response of fatigue properties to cold stretching (CS), low-cycle fatigue (LCF) tests were performed at room temperature, with total strain amplitudes ranging from \u00b10.4% to \u00b10.8%. Martensite transformations were measured during the tests. Comparisons on cyclic stress response, cyclic stress-strain behavior, and fatigue life were carried out between SA and CS materials. Results show that CS reduces the initial hardening stage, but prolongs the softening period in the cyclic stress response.

Experiments using a two-stage light gas gun were conducted to investigate the impact process and to validate the finite element model. The energy absorption efficiency (EAE) of CFRP laminates with different thickness was investigated. According to the results of experiments and numerical calculations, thin CFRP laminates have a good EAE under relative higher velocity impact; by contraries, a superior EAE is displayed in thick laminates under relative lower velocity impact. Subsequently, EAE of CFRP laminates was compared with that of 304 stainless-steel plates. In a specific impact velocity range, EAE of CFRP laminates is higher than that of 304 stainless-steel.

However, the molecular mechanisms of PME action on pectins are not well understood. In order to understand how PMEs modify pectins during banana (Musa spp.)-Fusarium interaction, the expression and enzyme activities of PMEs in two banana cultivars, highly resistant or susceptible to Fusarium, were compared with each other. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of PMEs and their effect on pectin methylesterification of 10 individual homogalacturonan (HG) epitopes with different degrees of methylesterification (DMs) were also examined. The results showed that, before pathogen treatment, the resistant cultivar displayed higher PME activity than the susceptible cultivar, corresponding well to the lower level of pectin DM. A significant increase in PME expression and activity and a decrease in pectin DM were observed in the susceptible cultivar but not in the resistant cultivar when plants were wounded, which was necessary for successful infection. With the increase of PME in the wounded susceptible cultivar, the JIM5 antigen (low methyestrified HGs) increased. Forty-eight hours after pathogen infection, the PME activity and expression in the susceptible cultivar were higher than those in the resistant cultivar, while the DM was lower. In conclusion, the resistant and the susceptible cultivars differ significantly in their response to wounding. Increased PMEs and thereafter decreased DMs acompanied by increased low methylesterified HGs in the root vascular cylinder appear to play a key role in determination of banana susceptibility to Fusarium. \u00a9 2013 \u00a9 The Author(2) [2013].", "keywords": ["Banana (Musa spp.)", "degree of pectin methylesterification", "Fusarium wilt", "host-", "pathogen interaction", "pectin methylesterases", "wound induced"], "venue": "Journal of Experimental Botany", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309c748c"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhitao Li", "org": ""}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": ""}, {"name": "Mengyu Gan", "org": ""}, {"name": "Jun Yan", "org": ""}, {"name": "Haifeng Hu", "org": ""}, {"name": "Jun Zeng", "org": ""}, {"name": "Feifei Chen", "org": ""}], "title": "Characterization and anticorrosive properties of poly(2,3-dimethylaniline)/ TiO", "abstract": "Poly(2,3-dimethylaniline)/TiO", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Polymer Composites", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309c869a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Electronic, Information and Electrical Engineering"}, {"name": "Xiubin Zhang", "org": "Department of Electronic, Information and Electrical Engineering"}, {"name": "Ke Wang", "org": "China National Aeronautical Electronic Radio Research Institute"}, {"name": "Tao Xu", "org": "Department of Electronics and Information Engineering"}], "title": "A general method for module automatic testing in avionics systems", "abstract": "The traditional Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) systems are insufficient to cope with the challenges of testing more and more complex avionics systems.

The measured failure loads obtained in the experiments showed reasonable agreement with the analytical predictions. \u00a9 2013.", "keywords": ["Composite", "Mechanical properties", "Sandwich panel", "Thermal exposure"], "venue": "Journal of Materials Science and Technology", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309d2033"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhitao Li", "org": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering"}, {"name": "Wanglin Li", "org": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering"}, {"name": "Mengyu Gan", "org": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering"}, {"name": "Wei Qiu", "org": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering"}, {"name": "Jun Yan", "org": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering"}], "title": "Characterization and anticorrosive properties of poly(2,3-dimethylaniline)/nano-Al2O3 composite synthesized by emulsion polymerization", "abstract": "Poly(2,3-dimethylaniline)/nano-Al", "keywords": ["Corrosion protection", "Electrochemistry", "Emulsion polymerization", "Nano-Al2O3", "Poly(2,3-dimethylaniline)"], "venue": "Polymers for Advanced Technologies", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309cb795"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": ""}, {"name": "Xuebing Li", "org": ""}, {"name": "Shihong Ding", "org": ""}, {"name": "Jun Zhang", "org": ""}], "title": "Global stability of cascaded systems with non-smooth continuity", "abstract": "The local/global Lipschitz continuity is always required when considering the stability of the cascaded systems.

The tests demonstrate that delamination of the facesheet is the primary failure mode of this sandwich structure other than the debonding between the facesheets and core for conventional sandwiches. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Materials and Design", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfde486cef66309f1a35"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "College of Chemistry and Molecular Science, Wuhan University"}, {"name": "Changjiang Zhou", "org": "College of Chemistry and Molecular Science, Wuhan University"}, {"name": "Quanzhu Yang", "org": "College of Chemistry and Molecular Science, Wuhan University"}, {"name": "Xiaogang Yang", "org": "College of Chemistry and Molecular Science, Wuhan University"}, {"name": "Chao Zhang", "org": "School of Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University"}, {"name": "Liqiong Liao", "org": "Suzhou Institute of Wuhan University"}], "title": "Polymeric supramolecular materials and their biomedical applications", "keywords": ["Biosensor", "Drug delivery", "Supramolecular", "Tissue engineering"], "venue": "Current Organic Chemistry", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309c9e87"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhiyong Wang", "org": "College of Mechanics, Taiyuan University of Technology"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Center for Composite Materials and Structures, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, {"name": "Hongjun Yu", "org": "Institute of Applied Mathematics, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, {"name": "Linzhi Wu", "org": "Center for Composite Materials and Structures, Harbin Institute of Technology"}], "title": "Dynamic stress intensity factors for homogeneous and non-homogeneous materials using the interaction integral method", "abstract": "An interaction integral is derived for the computation of dynamic stress intensity factors for both homogeneous and non-homogeneous materials.

To attempt to infer that experimentally, test populations were established by transferring a subset of the original populations, which had been grown on banana for many generations, onto navel orange, and then subculturing the navel orange population and banana population for at least 20 generations. Four pairs of SSR primers with high polymorphism on laboratory strains were used to detect population genetic differentiation. All six tested populations (the 5th, 10th and 15th generations of B. dorsalis fed on banana and navel orange, respectively) were found to have low genetic diversity. Furthermore, the genetic diversity of the navel orange populations was found to decline after being crossed for several generations. Populations initially were deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, however, equilibrium was achieved with increasing numbers of generations in both of the host populations. Limited gene flows were found among the six populations. The Nei's standard genetic distances between the two host populations of the same generation were initially low, but increased with generation number. Genetic distances between banana and navel orange populations of the same generation were lower than genetic distances between different generations grown on the same host plant. Analysis of molecular distance (AMOVA) results based on generation groups and host groups demonstrated that genetic variation among generations was greater than that between the two host populations. The results indicated that population genetic differentiation occurred after the host shift, albeit at low level.

Microwave absorbing properties were investigated by measuring complex permittivity and complex permeability in the frequency range of 26.5-40 GHz. As a result, chiral PANI/BF composite exhibited excellent microwave absorbing properties with the minimum reflection loss of -30.5 dB at 33.25 GHz with a thickness of only 0.9 mm, and the absorption bandwidth of the reflection loss below -10 dB could reach 12.8 GHz (from 26.5 to 39.3 GHz), which almost covered the whole Ka band (26.5-40 GHz). The enhanced microwave absorbing properties were attributed to the helical structural characteristic and the good impedance matching between BF particles and chiral PANI. \u00a9 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Severe reductions in residual compressive modulus and strength were observed when sandwich panels were exposed to 300 C for 6 h. The effect of high temperature exposure on failure mode of sandwich panel was revealed as well. Delamination and low fiber to matrix adhesion caused by the degradation of the matrix properties were found for the specimens exposed to 300 C.

Their structures and properties were systematically studied. Compared with PANI-LS-A, the PANI-LS-M exhibited a much higher conductivity, solubility, and thermo stability, which was due to the effective doping of the LS caused by the stretching and orientation effects of the MF. The conductivity of the PANI-LS-M (20.2 S/cm), which was prepared in the presence of a MF (0.4 T) with a polymerization yield of as much as 96%, was increased by four times compared with that of the PANI-LS-A (4.9 S/cm).

Methods We comprehensively searched PubMed, EMbase, The Cochrane library (Issue 4, 2014), CBM, CNKI and WanFang Data to collect SRs of traditional Chinese medicine for essential hypertension from the establishment time of databases to April 30th, 2014. The AMSTAR tool was applied for methodological quality assessment of included studies, and the GRADE system was applied for evidence quality assessment of included outcomes of SRs. Results A total of 12 SRs involving 31 outcomes were included, of which 11 SRs focused on the comparison of therapeutic effects between traditional Chinese medicine combined with western medicine and western medicine alone. Nine SRs adopted Jadad tool to assess methodological quality of included original studies. The results of assessment using AMSTAR showed that, among 11 items, there were the most problems concerning Item 1 \u201cWas an \u2018a prior\u2019 design provided?\u201d (none of the 12 SRs provided it); followed by Item 11 \u201cWere potential conflict of interest included?\u201d (nine SRs didn\u2019t described it), and Item 6 \u201cWere the characteristics of included studies provided\u201d (six SRs didn\u2019t provided it). The results of grading showed that, 29 outcomes were graded as \u201clow\u201d or \u201cvery low\u201d quality. The main factors contributed to downgrading evidence quality were limitations (31 outcomes), followed by imprecision (12 outcomes), and inconsistency (13 outcomes). Conclusion Currently, the methodological quality of SRs about traditional Chinese medicine for essential hypertension was poor on the whole, with low quality of evidence as well as lack of enough attention to the end outcomes of patients with essential hypertension.

Methods: We examined the Musashi-1 mRNA expression level in 35 fresh EAC tissue samples and 15 normal endometrium samples by real-time RT-PCR, and its protein expression level in 148 paraffin EAC tissue samples and 20 paraffin normal endometrium samples by immunohistochemistry. The correlation between Musashi-1 and overall survival (OS) used Cox proportional hazards regression.

Results: Musashi-1 mRNA expression of EAC is 2.8-fold higher than that of normal endometrium (P = 0.0009). Musashi-1 protein expression level is correlated with tumor stage, grade and vascular invasion. Patients with higher protein expression level of Musashi-1 are associated with poor survival rate than those with negative or low level of expression (HR = 2.073, P = 0.001).

These treatments were also conducted in the presence or absence of insulin and the cells were analysed by western blot and quantitative real-time PCR. In addition, nuleotide levels were determined using HPLC. The activation of AMPK with AICAR enhanced the mRNA levels of MAFbx and MuRF1. Insulin reduced the phosphorylation and activity AMPK, which was accompanied by reduced MAFbx and MuRF1 mRNA levels. Using a protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) inhibitor, we found that insulin regulates AMPK through the activation of Akt. Furthermore, insulin down-regulated AMPK \u03b12 mRNA. We conclude that insulin inhibits AMPK through Akt phosphorylation in L6 myotubes, which may serve as a possible signalling pathway for the down-regulation of protein degradation. In addition, decreased expression of AMPK \u03b12 may partially participate in inhibiting the activity of AMPK.", "keywords": ["AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)", "Insulin", "Muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx)", "Muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1)", "Myotubes"], "venue": "Bioscience Reports", "year": 2015, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309c945b"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jihai Tang", "org": "Research Institute of China Ordnance Industry"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "College of Materials Science and Engineering, Chongqing University"}, {"name": "Qisheng Huo", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Inorganic Synthesis and Preparative Chemistry, College of Chemistry, Jilin University"}, {"name": "Jun Yan", "org": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University"}, {"name": "Mengyu Gan", "org": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University"}, {"name": "Fenfang Xu", "org": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University"}], "title": "Effect of a constant magnetic field (0.4 T) on electromagnetic properties of chiral polyaniline", "abstract": "Chiral polyaniline doped with d-camphorsulfonic acid (d-CSA) (PANI-(d-CSA)) was synthesized by in situ polymerization in the presence of a constant magnetic field (0.4 T).

Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, rheological observations, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) have been used to confirm the changes in the coherent tertiary structure of soy protein after modification, increasing the interconnection between the molecular chains. Finally, we have been able to produce a modified soy protein film, which provides a good combination of tensile strength and extensibility under either dry (10 \u00b1 2 MPa and 25 \u00b1 3%) or wet (5 \u00b1 1 MPa and 200 \u00b1 20%) conditions. In addition the modified soy protein film has unexpectedly been found to exhibit antimicrobial properties, and this adds to the merits of the final product. We believe that the method described further broadens the application of natural soy protein-based materials, for example in antimicrobial packaging films.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Journal of Materials Chemistry B", "year": 2015, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309e7f33"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jun Zhang", "org": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University"}, {"name": "Mengyu Gan", "org": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University"}, {"name": "Fangfang Yang", "org": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University"}, {"name": "Shenna Fu", "org": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University"}, {"name": "Xiao Li", "org": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Chongqing University"}], "title": "Well-dispersed platinum nanoparticles supported on hierarchical nitrogen-doped porous hollow carbon spheres with enhanced activity and stability for methanol electrooxidation", "abstract": "Hierarchical nitrogen-doped porous hollow carbon spheres (HNPHCS) with porous-thin mesoporous shell and hollow macroporous core structure have been prepared via in-situ oxidation polymerization method using polyaniline as the precursor.

Data were used in a previously published model and empirically calibrated to country-specific epidemiological data. Strategies differed by initial test, targeted age, frequency of screening, number of clinic visits required (1, 2 or 3) and service delivery setting (national, county and township levels). Outcomes included lifetime risk of cancer, years of life saved (YLS), lifetime costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (cost per YLS). For all screening frequencies, the most efficient strategy used 2-visit rapid HPV-DNA testing at the county level, including screening and diagnostics in the first visit, and treatment in the second visit. Screening at ages 35, 40 and 45 reduced cancer risk by 50% among women compliant with all 3 screening rounds, and was US$ 150 per YLS, compared with this same strategy applied twice per lifetime. This would be considered very cost-effective evaluated against China's per-capita gross domestic product (US$ 1,702).

Recently, several studies have confirmed that some polymorphisms of this gene can influence its expression level, therefore speculating that they might be associated with autoimmune diseases. In order to investigate the role of the CTLA-4 gene in ITP, we investigated -318 and CT60 polymorphisms of the CTLA-4 gene in 186 ITP patients and 162 healthy controls through polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism. No signicant differences were revealed in genotypes and allele distributions between the patients with ITP and the controls in both sites. Similar results were observed between the two groups when stratified by first onset age and disease course including acute childhood, chronic childhood, acute adult, and chronic adult.

Using data on sexual behaviour, test accuracy, diagnostic practices and costs from studies performed in rural China, we estimated the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) and associated lifetime outcomes for once-lifetime and twice-lifetime screening strategies, and for routine screening at 5-yearly, 10-yearly and IARC-recommended intervals. The optimal age range for once-lifetime screening was also assessed.Results: For all strategies, the relative ordering of test technologies in reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality was VIA (least effective); VIA/VILI; careHPV@1.0 pg/ml and careHPV@0.5 pg/ml (most effective). For once-lifetime strategies, maximum effectiveness was achieved if screening occurred between 35-50 years. Assuming a participation rate of ~70%, once-lifetime screening at age 35 years would reduce cancer mortality by 8% (for VIA) to 12% (for careHPV@0.5) over the long term, with a CER of US$557 (for VIA) to $959 (for careHPV@1.0) per life year saved (LYS) compared to no intervention; referenced to a 2008 GDP per capita in Shanxi Province of $2,975. Correspondingly, regular screening with an age-standardised participation rate of 62% (which has been shown to be achievable in this setting) would reduce cervical cancer mortality by 19-28% (for 10-yearly screening) to 43-54% (using IARC-recommended intervals), with corresponding CERs ranging from $665 (for 10-yearly VIA) to $2,269 (for IARC-recommended intervals using careHPV@1.0) per LYS.Conclusions: This modelled analysis suggests that primary careHPV screening compares favourably to visual inspection screening methodologies in rural China, particularly if used as part of a regular screening program. \u00a9 2011 Shi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "BMC Cancer", "year": 2011, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309ddcca"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Zeping Zhou", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Hongmei Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Hu Zhou", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Donglei Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Huiyuan Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Aiping Qi", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Renchi Yang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}], "title": "Increased expressions of DNA methyltransferases contribute to CD70 promoter hypomethylation and over expression of CD70 in ITP", "abstract": "CD70 (TNFSF7), as a methylation susceptive immune gene, was hypomethylated in some autoimmune diseases.

The aim of this retrospective study was to determine which factors are crucial for effective mobilization and collection of autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) prior to transplantation in Chinese patients. Patients and methods: A total of 239 patients with lymphoma (198 NHL and 41 HL patients) underwent PBSC collection after mobilization with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or G-CSF plus chemotherapy priming. Results: Patient characteristics at diagnosis and transplant, including low Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score (P = 0.013), lack of extranodal invasion (P = 0.034), previously administered radiotherapy regimens (P = 0.040), treatment with platinum prior to mobilization (P = 0.042), previous chemotherapy regimens (P = 0.001) and cycles (P < 0.001), and chemotherapy regimens (P < 0.001) were statistically significant for successful mobilization in multivariate analysis. Premobilization factors, including previous radiotherapy (P = 0.009), previous chemotherapy regimens (P = 0.043) and cycles (P = 0.039), low platelet count prior to mobilization (P = 0.042), and lower CD34+ cells in peripheral blood (PB) (P = 0.050) or bone marrow (BM) (P = 0.007) were considered possibly predictive of poor mobilization. We found the patients who had chemosensitive lymphoma had worse progress-free survival (PFS) than the patients with initial treatment and high risks (P = 0.017). Conclusion: Our analysis showed that high amounts of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, low platelet count, chemosensitive recurrent patients, combination chemotherapy plus G-CSF and low CD34+ cells in BM prior to mobilization could emerged as important predictive factors for mobilization failure in Chinese patients with NHL and HL.

Interleukin-27 (IL-27) can regulate T cell differentiation. However, it is unclear whether IL-27 correlates with the dysfunctions of T cell differentiation in ITP patients. Thus, to determine the roles of IL-27 in ITP, we studied the expression of IL-27/IL-27 receptor in ITP patients. The results indicated that the levels of IL-27 in the plasma of untreated active ITP patients were higher than in normal controls. We next evaluated the contribution of IL-27 to T cell differentiation. Our results indicated that IL-27 increased T-bet expression, inhibited GATA-3 and ROR-\u03b3t expression, and promoted the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, and granzyme B of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ITP patients. Also, we confirmed that IL-27 induced the differentiation of T helper (Th)-1 and Tc1 cells.

Using a modified stable isotope labeling in cell culture (SILAC) approach in HEK293 cells and Flag-tagged cortactin (F-cortactin) as bait, we identified a limited set of cortactin interactions including several proteins which have not previously been identified as cortactin associated proteins.

The interaction between cortactin and RCC2/TD60 was verified in cell lysates immunoprecitated with anti-RCC2/TD60 antibody. Furthermore, cortactin was localized by immunofluorescence in the equatorial plane of dividing HeLa cells in the region where RCC2/TD60 has previously been localized thus providing support for a complex containing cortactin and RCC2/TD60 complex that may play a functional role in cells undergoing mitosis. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.", "keywords": ["Cortactin", "Focal adhesion", "RCC2/TD60", "SILAC"], "venue": "Journal of Proteomics", "year": 2012, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309ea096"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wei Gao", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Hong-Ju Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Yu-Juan Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Guo-Qiang Chang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Jian Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Hua-Wen Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Tian-Xiang Pang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}], "title": "Effect of cariporide on angiogenesis induced by K562 cells", "abstract": "Aim: To explore the effect of cariporide on angiogenesis induced by K562 cells.

In PBMCs from ITP patients, the proliferation of autoreactive T, B lymphocytes and destruction of autologous platelets were dramatically suppressed by UC-MSCs. UC-MSCs not only suppressed co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD40L and FasL expression but also in shifting Th1/Th2/Treg cytokines profile in ITP patients. UC-MSCs obviously reversed the dysfunctions of mega-karyocytes by promoting platelet production and decreasing the number of living megakaryocytes as well as early apoptosis.

Screening costs were robust to screening volume (<5% variation if 2,000 women screened annually), but costs of colposcopy/biopsy tripled at the lower volume. Direct medical costs of Loop Excision, Cold-Knife Conization and Simple and Radical Hysterectomy varied from $61544, depending on the procedure and whether conducted at county or prefecture level. Direct non-medical expenditure varied from $0.68$3.09 for screening/ diagnosis and $83$494 for pre-cancer/cancer treatment. Conclusions: Diagnostic costs were comparable to screening costs for high-volume screening but were greatly increased in lower-volume situations, which is a key consideration for the scale-up phase of new programs. The studys findings will facilitate cost-effectiveness evaluation and budget planning for cervical cancer prevention initiatives in China. \u00a9 2012 Shi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "BMC Health Services Research", "year": 2012, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309e739e"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Zeping Zhou", "org": "Department of Hematology"}, {"name": "Donglei Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Hongmei Wang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Huiyuan Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Feng Xue", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}, {"name": "Renchi Yang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology"}], "title": "Bmi-1 regulates autoreactive CD4 + T cell survival in immune thrombocytopenia patients", "abstract": "Autoreactive T cells in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients undergo a rapid clonal expansion and are resistant to apoptosis to maintain continuous effect in thrombocytopenia.

Methods: Markov model was used to calculate the long-term effectiveness, utility, benefit and cost among screened and unscreened cohorts in rural and urban areas, and then analyses of cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and cost-benefit were performed. The assessed screening strategies were acetic acid of visual inspection combined with Lugol's iodine staining (VIA/VILI), conventional Pap smear and simple HPV DNA testing (careHPV) in rural areas, and conventional Pap smear, simple HPV DNA testing (careHPV), HPV DNA testing (HC2) and liquid-based cytology (LBC) alone or combined with HPV DNA testing (LBC + HC2) in urban areas. We estimated the life outcomes and cost-effectiveness of the above screening strategies at one-year, 3-year and 5-year intervals. Results: All of the screening strategies were effective to decrease cervical cancer mortality and to increase life years, with a trend of shorter screening interval having better effectiveness. However, no matter in urban or rural areas, compared with careHPV testing at 5-year interval, the costs of other screening strategies were 1.28-13.86 folds, 1.31-14.14 folds, and 1.27-12.80 folds higher to avoid one death, to save a year of life, and a QALY, and the benefit per cost of other screening strategies was 9.9%-90.2%.

This study aims to establish a standard animal model of severe burn-blast combined injury in rats and also to investigate early phasic changes of blood coagulation. By using 54 Wistar rats, distance from explosion source (Hexogen) and size of burned body surface area were determined to induce severe burn-blast combined injury. Thereafter, 256 rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 64): blast injury group, burn injury group, burn-blast combined injury group, and sham injury group. Gross anatomy and pathological changes in lungs were investigated at 3, 24, 72, and 168 h, respectively. Blood was also collected for analyzing coagulation parameters as prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and plasma levels of fibrinogen, D-dimer, antithrombin III, and \u03b12-antiplasmin from 0 to 168 h after injury. Severe burn-blast combined injury was induced by inflicting rats with a moderate blast injury when placing rats 75 cm away from explosion source and a full-thickness burn injury of 25% total body surface area. The rats with burn-blast combined injury had more severe lung injuries when compared with the other three groups. Pathological examination in the BBL group showed diffused alveolar hemorrhage, fluid filling, alveolar atelectasis, rupture and hyperplasia of partial alveolar septum, emphysema-like change, reduced capillary bed, and infiltration of extensive polymorphonuclear cells after injury. The blood of combined injured rats was in a hypercoagulable state within 24 h, shortly restored from 24 to 48 h, and rehypercoagulated from 48 to 72 h after injury. A secondary excessively fibrinolytic function was also found thereafter. The rat model of burn-blast combined injury was successfully established by simulating real explosion characteristics. Rats with burn-blast combined injuries suffered from more severe lung injuries and abnormal coagulation and fibrinolytic function than those induced by a burn injury or a blast injury component. Hence, a time-dependent treatment strategy on coagulation function should be emphasized in clinical therapy of burn-blast combined injury.

Increase of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and growth factors is considerably involved in blood-brain barrier disruption and neuronal cell death in ICH models. We therefore hypothesized that increased levels of these molecular markers are associated with perihematomal edema and clinical outcome in ICH patients. Methods-Fifty-nine patients with spontaneous ICH admitted within 24 hours of symptom onset were prospectively investigated. Noncontrast CT was performed on admission for diagnosis of ICH and quantification of initial hematoma volume. MRI was performed on day 3 to evaluate perihematomal edema. Concentrations of MMP-3, MMP-9, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-1 on admission were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Clinical outcome was assessed by modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. Results-Increased MMP-3 levels were independently associated with perihematomal edema volume (P<0.05). Cytotoxic edema surrounding the hematoma was seen in 36 (61%) cases on 3-day MRI. Cytotoxic edema did not correlate with the level of any of the biomarkers studied. Levels of MMP-3 \u226512.4 ng/mL and MMP-9 \u2265192.4 ng/mL but not vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-1 predicted poor clinical outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale >3) independent of stroke severity and hematoma volume at baseline (odds ratio, 25.3, P=0.035; odds ratio, 68.9, P=0.023; respectively).

Results Ultimately, six RCTs involving a total of 2,759 patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection were included in this meta-analysis. The outcomes showed that the sustained virologic response (SVR) rate was significantly higher in the TPR group (1,284/1,932, 66.5%) than in the PR group (296/827, 35.8%) with a pooled odds ratio (OR) [3.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.43-5.96, p<0.001]. The results also showed that the relapse rate was significantly lower in the TPR group (190/1,484, 12.8%) than in the PR group (140/ 425, 32.9%) with a pooled risk ratio (RR) (0.40; 95% CI 0.24-0.66, p<0.001). However, there was an increased risk of serious adverse events in the TPR group (RR=1.45, 95% CI 1.12-1.87, p=0.005).

By using a microRNA microarray approach, we have identified that miRNA-32-5p expression is significantly reduced under hyperglycemic conditions in rat bone marrow-derived MSCs. Expression of miRNA-32-5p targets the 3'-untranslated region of the mRNA encoding phosphatase and tensin homologs deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. Exposure to high glucose levels reduced miR-32-5p expression, induced PTEN expression, and inhibited activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway of MSCs. Conversely, overexpression of miR-32-5p inhibited the expression of PTEN, ameliorated the inhibitory effect of high glucose levels on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and promoted cell cycle progression from G0/G1 to G2/M and S phases. Our study indicates that exposure of MSCs to hyperglycemic conditions reduces miR-32-5p expression and disturbs cell cycle progression through a PTEN-mediated inhibitory effect on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. In summary, MiR-32-5p is a potentially important therapeutic agent for preventing MSC dysfunction under hyperglycemic conditions. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc.", "keywords": ["G0/G1 phase", "High glucose", "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)", "MicroRNAs", "Phosphatase and tensin homologs deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway"], "venue": "Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309c5b6a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Iuliana Susnea", "org": ""}, {"name": "Bogdan Bernevic", "org": ""}, {"name": "Michael Wicke", "org": ""}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": ""}, {"name": "Shuying Liu", "org": ""}, {"name": "Karl Schellander", "org": ""}, {"name": "Michael Przybylski", "org": ""}], "title": "Application of MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry to proteome analysis using stain-free gel electrophoresis", "abstract": "The combination of MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry with gel electrophoretic separation using protein visualization by staining procedures involving such as Coomassie Brilliant Blue has been established as a widely used approach in proteomics. Although this approach has been shown to present high detection sensitivity, drawbacks and limitations frequently arise from the significant background in the mass spectrometric analysis. In this chapter we describe an approach for the application of MALDI-MS to the mass spectrometric identification of proteins from one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoretic separation, using stain-free detection and visualization based on native protein fluorescence. Using the native fluorescence of aromatic protein amino acids with UV transmission at 343 nm as a fast gel imaging system, unstained protein spots are localized and, upon excision from gels, can be proteolytically digested and analyzed by MALDI-MS. Following the initial development and testing with standard proteins, applications of the stain-free gel electrophoretic detection approach to mass spectrometric identification of biological proteins from 2D-gel separations clearly show the feasibility and efficiency of this combination, as illustrated by a proteomics study of porcine skeleton muscle proteins. Major advantages of the stain-free gel detection approach with MALDI-MS analysis are (1) rapid analysis of proteins from 1D- and 2D-gel separation without destaining required prior to proteolytic digestion, (2) the low detection limits of proteins attained, and (3) low background in the MALDI-MS analysis. \u00a9 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "keywords": ["Gel electrophoresis", "MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry", "Native fluorescence", "Protein identification", "Skeleton muscle proteomics"], "venue": "Topics in Current Chemistry", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309aca7b"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Pei-Pei Zhang", "org": "Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery"}, {"name": "Jia-Ke Chai", "org": "Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery"}, {"name": "Ji-Ping Wang", "org": "Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery"}, {"name": "Hong-Jie Duan", "org": "Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery"}, {"name": "Gui-Ying Zhu", "org": "Department of Burns and Plastic Surgery"}], "title": "Functions of exogenous application of connective tissue growth factor in stimulating human dermal papilla cells and human hair follicle outer root sheath cells for reconstructive tissue-engineering hair follicles", "abstract": "Objective: To explore the functions of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in the restoration of hair follicles with a mixture of human dermal papilla cells and human hair follicle outer root sheath cells in vitro in nude mice.

Cell apoptosis in nephridial tissues of patients with HBVGN were determined by the TUNEL method. HBx, p-STAT3 and STAT3 levels in nephridial tissues were determined by immunohistochemical assay, and a correlation analysis between HBx expression levels and apoptosis index in nephridial tissues was conducted. The activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in HK-2 cells and the expression of the apoptosis-related proteins Bax and Bcl-2 were determined by western blot analysis following transfection with the HBx eukaryotic expression vector.

Then we compared its effects with electroacupuncture at nonchannel points, vagal nerve stimulation, or intraperitoneal administration of cholinergic agonist. Cytokine levels in plasma and tissue of intestine, lung, and liver were assessed 60 min after reperfusion. Intestinal barrier injury was detected by histology, gut injury score, the permeability to 4 kDa FITC-dextran, and changes in tight junction protein ZO-1 using immunofluorescence and Western blot. Electroacupuncture significantly lowered the levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-8 in plasma and organ tissues, decreased intestinal permeability to FITC-dextran, and prevented changes in ZO-1 protein expression and localization. However, abdominal vagotomy or intraperitoneal administration of cholinergic \u03b17nAChR inhibitor reversed these effects of electroacupuncture.

Lipid peroxidation plays a critical role in burn-induced plasma leakage, and ulinastatin has been reported to reduce lipid peroxidation in various models. This study aims to examine whether ulinastatin reduces fluid requirements through inhibition of lipid peroxidation in a swine burn model. Methods. Forty miniature swine were subjected to 40% TBSA burns and were randomly allocated to the following four groups: immediate lactated Ringer's resuscitation (ILR), immediate LR containing ulinastatin (ILR/ULI), delayed LR resuscitation (DLR), and delayed LR containing ulinastatin (DLR/ULI). Hemodynamic variables, net fluid accumulation, and plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentrations were measured. Heart, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, and ileum were harvested at 48 hours after burn for evaluation of TBARS concentrations, activities of antioxidant enzymes, and tissue water content. Results. Ulinastatin significantly reduced pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) and extravascular lung water index (ELWI), net fluid accumulation, and water content of heart, lung, and ileum in both immediate or delayed resuscitation groups. Furthermore, ulinastatin infusion significantly reduced plasma and tissue concentrations of TBARS in both immediate or delayed resuscitation groups. Conclusions.

The treatment of fibroblasts with Zebularine or Zebularine plus Scriptaid increased histone acetylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9), but decreased the level of DNA methylation of Oct-4 and Sox-2 promoter regions. When donor cells were used after Zebularine plus Scriptaid treatment to reconstruct cloned embryos and then treated with Scriptaid, the developmental competence and cryosurvival of embryos were improved significantly. In addition, the relative expression of Oct-4 and Sox-2 were increased significantly. The expression levels of Dnmt-1 and Hdac-1 were significantly decreased when fibroblasts and cloned embryos were treated with Zebularine or Scriptaid. This work provides functional evidence that treatment with Zebularine and Scriptaid modifies the epigenetic status of yak fibroblasts, subsequently enhancing in vitro developmental potential and the quality of yak cloned embryos. \u00a9 Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Cellular Reprogramming", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309c9137"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Da-Wei Li", "org": "Burns Institute"}, {"name": "Chuan-An Shen", "org": "Burns Institute"}, {"name": "Jia-Ke Chai", "org": "Burns Institute"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Burns Institute"}, {"name": "Yu-Ru Shang", "org": "Burns Institute"}, {"name": "Long-Zhu Li", "org": "Burns Institute"}], "title": "Structural and functional changes in islet beta cells in severely scalded rats", "abstract": "Objective: To observe the structural and functional changes in islet beta cells in severely scalded rats, and to explore its relationship with dysfunction of glycometabolism.

Computed tomography (CT) revealed osteolytic change in each twin's skull, and the elder exhibited poor eyesight. There were massive histiocyte-like cells surrounded by eosinophils in pathologic specimen of the abnormal lesions, which is typical pathologic finding in LCH. These pathologic cells were positive for S-100 and the cell surface protein CD1 antigen (CD1&\u03b1), the known markers of LCH.

The continuous eccentric exercise (CE) significantly enhanced muscle SOD2 mRNA level at 0.5 h (P<0.05). After once-only eccentric exercise (OE), SOD1, SOD2, and SOD3 mRNA expression significantly increased at 96 h, whereas MDA concentrations decreased at 96 h. After CE, the correlation coefficients of SOD1, SOD2, SOD3 mRNA expression levels and MDA concentrations were -0.814, -0.763, -0.845 (all P<0.05) at 12 h.Conclusion:Regular eccentric exercise, especially CE could enhance SOD1 and SOD2 mRNA expression in acute stage and the SOD2 mRNA expression correlates to MDA concentration in vivo, which may improve the oxidative adaption ability of skeletal muscles. \u00a9 2013 Zhao et al.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309bcb68"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion"}, {"name": "Pan Sun", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion"}, {"name": "Fangzhao Lin", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion"}, {"name": "Ge Diao", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion"}, {"name": "Changqing Li", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion"}], "title": "In vitro evaluation of residual procoagulants in human intravenous immunoglobulins from 11 Chinese blood fractionation companies", "abstract": "Introduction Residual procoagulants has been suggested to play an important role in the occurrence of thromboembolic events with intravenous immunoglobulin. Objective This study investigated the predominant plasma proteases in 81 intravenous immunoglobulin lots from 11 Chinese manufacturers to examine the procoagulants of these human therapeutic intravenous immunoglobulin products. Methods In one-stage clotting assays, the procoagulant activities of factors II, VII, IX, X, XI, and XII were quantified. Non-activated partial thromboplastin time and a modified thrombin generation test served as global and activated coagulation factor XI specific clotting assays, respectively. Results The coagulation factor clotting activities of the 78 intravenous immunoglobulin lots were below the detection limit of the assays. The time to peak of thrombin generation using a thrombin generation test was longer than 35 min. The relevant amount of activated coagulation factor XI was below 0.37 nM. Non-activated partial thromboplastin time was greater than 203 s, except for the three pilot samples of manufacturer B in which we observed 0.48 to 0.09 IU/mL factor XI lever, 20 to 26 min for the time to peak of thrombin generation, 0.54 to 37.99 nM activated coagulation factor XI, and 155 to 182 s for non-activated partial thromboplastin time.

Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to about 45% of total blood volume loss followed by delayed fluid replacement (DFR) with Ringer lactate 3h after hemorrhage. In a first study, rats were randomly divided into six groups: (1) EAN: EA at non-channel acupoints followed by DFR; (2) EA: EA at ST36 after hemorrhage followed by DFR; (3) VGX/EA: vagotomy (VGX) before EA at ST36 and DFR; (4) VGX/EAN: VGX before EAN and DFR; (5) \u03b1-bungarotoxin (\u03b1-BGT)/EA:intraperitoneal injection of \u03b1-BGT before hemorrhage, followed by EA at ST36 and DFR; and (6) \u03b1-BGT/EAN group: \u03b1-BGT injection before hemorrhage followed by EAN and DFR. Survival and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were monitored over the next 12 h. In a second study, with the same grouping and treatment, cytokine levels in plasma and intestine, organ parameters, gut injury score, gut permeability to 4 kDa FITC-dextran, and expression and distribution of tight junction protein ZO-1 were evaluated. Results: MAP was significantly lowered after blood loss; EA at ST36 improved the blood pressure at corresponding time points 3 and 12 h after hemorrhage. EA at ST36 reduced tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-6 levels in both plasma and intestine homogenates after blood loss and DFR, while vagotomy or intraperitoneal injection of \u03b1-BGT before EA at ST36 reversed its anti-inflammatory effects, and EA at ST36 did not influence IL-10 levels in plasma and intestine. EA at ST36 alleviated the injury of intestinal villus, the gut injury score being significantly lower than that of EAN group (1.85 \u00b1 0.33 vs 3.78 \u00b1 0.59, P < 0.05). EA at ST36 decreased intestinal permeability to FITCdextran compared with EAN group (856.95 ng/mL \u00b1 90.65 ng/mL vs 2305.62 ng/mL \u00b1 278.32 ng/mL, P < 0.05). EA at ST36 significantly preserved ZO-1 protein expression and localization at 12 h after hemorrhage. However, EA at non-channel acupoints had no such effect, and abdominal vagotomy and \u03b1-BGT treatment could weaken or eliminate the effects of EA at ST36. Besides, EA at ST36 decreased blood aminotransferase, MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase and creatinine vs EAN group at corresponding time points. At the end of 12-h experiment, the survival rate of the EA group was significantly higher than that of the other groups. Conclusion: EA at ST36 attenuates the systemic inflammatory response, protects intestinal barrier integrity, improves organ function and survival rate after hemorrhagic shock via activating the cholinergic antiinflammatory mechanism. \u00a9 2013 Baishideng.

Thus, in this study, the effect of decrease in viral load and liver dysfunction resulting from telbivudine treatment on Th17 cells and the related cytokines IL-17, IL-22, and IL-23 were analyzed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum from twenty-four CHB patients were harvested at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks after initiation of telbivudine treatment.

The expression of serum IL-22 and IL-23, but not IL-17 also decreased during therapy.

This study aimed to assess the value of intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) video angiography with Flow 800 software in cerebrovascular surgery and to discover its hemodynamic features and changes of cerebrovascular diseases during surgery. Methods A total of 87 patients who received ICG-VA during various surgical procedures were enrolled in this study. Among them, 45 cases were cerebral aneurysms, 25 were cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and 17 were moyamoya disease (MMD). A surgical microscope integrating an infrared fluorescence module was used to confirm the residual aneurysms and blocking of perforating arteries in aneurysms. Feeder arteries, draining veins, and normal cortical vessels were identified by the time delay color mode of Flow 800 software. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded. All data were analyzed by SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., USA). T-test was used to analyze the hemodynamic features of AVMs and MMDs, the influence on peripheral cortex after resection in AVMs, and superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass in MMDs. Results The visual delay map obtained by Flow 800 software had more advantages than the traditional playback mode in identifying the feeder arteries, draining veins, and their relations to normal cortex vessels. The maximum fluorescence intensity (MFI) and the slope of ICG fluorescence curve of feeder arteries and draining veins were higher than normal peripheral vessels (MFI: 584.24\u00b185.86 vs. 382.94\u00b191.50, slope: 144.95\u00b138.08 vs. 69.20\u00b113.08, P <0.05).

However, variations in the serum fascin level in tumor patients are usually neglected. Materials and Methods: In the present study, serum samples from 501 stage I-IV NSCLC patients and 109 healthy volunteers were investigated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The serum fascin level was markedly increased in the NSCLC patients (P< 0.05), particularly in advanced cases (P< 0.01), compared with that in the healthy controls. We also found that the serum fascin level was significantly correlated with female sex (P= 0.02), non-smoking status (P= 0.044), and adenocarcinoma histology (P< 0.001), with a higher positive rate relative to each counterpart. Furthermore, our results suggested that the serum fascin level reflects the aggressive progress of both lymphatic (P< 0.001) and distant (P< 0.001) metastases in NSCLC. A survival analysis of 283 eligible patients who underwent a follow-up examination after 3 years revealed that the patients in the serum fascin-positive group had a significantly lower overall survival rate compared with those in the negative group for 134 non-distant metastatic (stage M0) cases (P= 0.044). A subsequent Cox regression analysis revealed that the serum fascin level was an independent prognostic factor for M0-stage NSCLC (univariate, P= 0.001; multivariate, P= 0.038).

K562 cells expressed a relatively higher level of CUEDC2 compared to K562/G01 cells.

In an artificial grassland established to restore a degraded meadow, parameters including coverage, species richness, diversity, and biomass (including above-and below-ground biomass) generally increased after four years of restoration. Likewise, soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (N), available N, total phosphorus (P), and available P exhibited the same trend. The activities of selected enzymes decreased with soil depth (P < 0.05) and increased during the successional process associated with restoration. Soil enzyme activities were related to the physico-chemical characteristics of the soil and plant primary production. After four years of restoration, the plants and soils were resilient to the grassland restoration process. The results of the present study suggest a significant positive impact of artificial grassland establishment on soil quality. Artificial grassland establishment was an effective measure for restoring heavily degraded alpine meadows in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau region. The rapid establishment of vegetative cover and plant functional group composition after artificial grassland construction are fundamental for limiting soil erosion and restoring the initial ecosystem function. As soil is a fundamental component of every terrestrial ecosystem, soil restoration is a vital process during ecological restoration. Thus, an increase in the nutrient status of the soil is important for the sustainable development of alpine meadows. The long-term accumulation of SOM, the retention of nutrients, and the buildup of microbial biomass are ultimately attributed to labile carbon input from plant primary production. \u00a9 2014 Taylor and Francis.", "keywords": ["alpine meadow", "enzyme activity", "microbial biomass", "plant community", "soil organic carbon"], "venue": "Israel Journal of Ecology and Evolution", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309e9dc5"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiao Hong Han", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology"}, {"name": "Yuan Kai Shi", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology"}, {"name": "Zheng Lyu", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology"}, {"name": "Hong Ying Yang", "org": "Department of Pathology"}, {"name": "Jia Rui Yao", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology"}, {"name": "Jian Li", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology"}, {"name": "Bo Li", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology"}, {"name": "Yan Qin", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology"}], "title": "Comparison of immunohistochemistry with fluorescence in situ hybridization in determining the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status of breast cancer specimens: A multicenter study of 3 149 Chinese patients", "abstract": "Background Accurate detection of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression and gene amplification is crucial for the application of HER2-specific therapy and for evaluating the response of patients with breast cancer.

Methods: One hundred rats following 1-h HS with mean arterial pressure 35 \u00b1 5 mmHg were randomly assigned to five groups (n = 10) in each of two comparable sets: group VR: intravenous resuscitation (VR) only and four groups with PR after VR: groups NS, LA, P1, and P2, resuscitated with normal saline, lactated peritoneal dialysis solution (PDS), pyruvated PDS, and 2.2% pyruvate, respectively. The splanchnic blood flow on surfaces of liver, kidney, and intestinal mucosa was detected. Blood samples were taken before HS and at T180 or T360 in these two animal sets after hemorrhage for function tests of liver, kidney, and intestinal mucosa, respectively. The intestinal mucosal barrier protein: zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) and tissue water contents of these organs were also determined. Results: Splanchnic blood flow was significantly preserved in all PR groups with hyperosmolar solutions: group P1 and group P2 with pyruvate were more advantageous than group LA. Group P2 was the most efficient among groups in reverse of visceral hypoperfusion. Organ function and tissue water contents of liver, kidney, and intestine and the intestinal barrier ZO-1 density were also improved in group P1 and group P2, compared with group LA. Among organs, the pyruvate protection of intestinal mucosa was the most apparent by reversing splanchnic blood flow and diamine oxidase close to reference ranges with the highest ZO-1 density. Group P2 showed the most pyruvate protection in all test parameters among four groups with PR. Conclusions: Peritoneal resuscitation with hyperosmolar fluids attenuated visceral vasoconstriction and splanchnic hypoperfusion and improved the intestinal barrier protein and organ function following conventional fluid resuscitation from severe HS in rats. Pyruvate was superior to lactate in PDS as PR fluids, and 2.2% pyruvate was the optimal fluid in PR.

Contributing factors include continuous loss of blood perfusion, excessive inflammation, and elevated apoptosis levels in wound tissue. Macroautophagy (here referred to simply as autophagy) is associated with many chronic diseases. The authors hypothesized that autophagy is involved in burn wound progression in a rat model of deep second-degree burn. Methods Deep second-degree burns were modeled using a brass rod heated to 100\u00b0C applied for 6 seconds to the back skin of Wistar rats. Full-thickness biopsies were obtained from burned and nonburned controls at several times postburn. Western blotting and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining determined expression of the autophagy markers Light Chain 3 (LC3) and beclin-1. Apoptosis was determined by terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF)-measured tissue perfusion. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity assay measured inflammation. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson's trichrome staining-determined pathology and wound depth. Results The LC3 and beclin-1 protein level in burn wounds decreased to one-fourth of normal levels (p < 0.01) over 24 hours and then began to increase but still did not reach their normal level. TUNEL-positive cells in burn wounds were 3.7-fold (p < 0.01) elevated over 48 hours and then decreased slightly, yet still remained higher than in normal skin. The burn wound progressed in depth over 72 hours. In addition, significant decrease in LDF values and upregulation of MPO activity were observed. Enhanced LC3-positive cells were observed in the deep dermal layer of burn wounds as shown by IHC staining. Conclusions A reduction in autophagy and blood flow and an increase in apoptosis and inflammation were observed in burn wounds early during the course of burn injury progression. This suggests that autophagy, complemented by apoptosis, play important roles in burn progression. Enhanced autophagy in the deep dermis may be a prosurvival mechanism against ischemia and inflammation after burn injury. \u00a9 2014 The Authors.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Academic Emergency Medicine", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309dcea5"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiaoting Zhao", "org": "Department of Cellular Biology, Beijing Chest Hospital, Capital Medical University"}, {"name": "Wentao Yue", "org": "Department of Cellular Biology, Beijing Chest Hospital, Capital Medical University"}, {"name": "Lina Zhang", "org": "Department of Cellular Biology, Beijing Chest Hospital, Capital Medical University"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Cellular Biology, Beijing Chest Hospital, Capital Medical University"}, {"name": "Wenyun Jia", "org": "Department of Cellular Biology, Beijing Chest Hospital, Capital Medical University"}, {"name": "Zhe Qian", "org": "Department of Cellular Biology, Beijing Chest Hospital, Capital Medical University"}, {"name": "Chunyan Zhang", "org": "Department of Cellular Biology, Beijing Chest Hospital, Capital Medical University"}, {"name": "Yue Wang", "org": "Department of Cellular Biology, Beijing Chest Hospital, Capital Medical University"}], "title": "Downregulation of PAX6 by shRNA inhibits proliferation and cell cycle progression of human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines", "abstract": "Background: The transcription factor PAX6 is primarily expressed in embryos. PAX6 is also expressed in several tumors and plays an oncogenic role. However, little is known about the role of PAX6 in lung cancer. Methods: The function of PAX6 in lung cancer cells was evaluated by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of the protein followed by analyses of cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and cell cycle arrest. The changes of cyclin D1, pRB, ERK1/2, p38 expression caused by PAX6 inhibition were detected using western-blotting. The PAX6 mRNA level in 52 pairs of tumors and corresponding matched adjacent normal tissues from non-small cell lung cancer patients and lung cancer cell lines was detected by real-time PCR. Results: Suppression of PAX6 expression inhibited cell growth and colony formation in A549 and H1299 cells. The percentage of cells in G1-phase increased when PAX6 expression was inhibited. The cyclin D1 protein level, as well as the pRB phosphorylation level, decreased as a result of PAX6 down-regulation. The activity of ERK1/2 and p38 was also suppressed in PAX6 knock-down cells. The PAX6 mRNA was highly expressed in lung cancer tissue and lung cancer cell lines. In most patients (about 65%), the relative ratio of PAX6 mRNA in primary NSCLC versus adjacent tissues exceeded 100. Conclusions: Our data implicated that PAX6 accelerates cell cycle progression by activating MAPK signal pathway. PAX6 mRNA levels were significantly elevated in primary lung cancer tissues compared to their matched adjacent tissues. \u00a9 2014 Zhao et al.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309cc9e3"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ning-Ning Zhang", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology, Peking Union Medical College, Cancer Institute and Hospital"}, {"name": "Yu-Tao Liu", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology, Peking Union Medical College, Cancer Institute and Hospital"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology, Peking Union Medical College, Cancer Institute and Hospital"}, {"name": "Lin Wang", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology, Peking Union Medical College, Cancer Institute and Hospital"}, {"name": "Xue-Zhi Hao", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology, Peking Union Medical College, Cancer Institute and Hospital"}, {"name": "Zheng Yuan", "org": "Department of Pathology, Peking Union Medical College, Cancer Institute and Hospital"}, {"name": "Dong-Mei Lin", "org": "Department of Pathology, Peking Union Medical College, Cancer Institute and Hospital"}, {"name": "Dan Li", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology, Peking Union Medical College, Cancer Institute and Hospital"}, {"name": "Yu-Jie Zhou", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology, Peking Union Medical College, Cancer Institute and Hospital"}, {"name": "Hua Lin", "org": "Department of Medical Record, Peking Union Medical College, Cancer Institute and Hospital"}, {"name": "Xiao-Hong Han", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology, Peking Union Medical College, Cancer Institute and Hospital"}, {"name": "Yan Sun", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology, Peking Union Medical College, Cancer Institute and Hospital"}, {"name": "Yuankai Shi", "org": "Department of Medical Oncology, Peking Union Medical College, Cancer Institute and Hospital"}], "title": "The molecular detection and clinical significance of ALK rearrangement in selected advanced non-small cell lung cancer: ALK expression provides insights into ALK targeted therapy", "keywords": [""], "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309e4612"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Wei Xiao", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"}, {"name": "Fangzhao Lin", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"}, {"name": "Pan Sun", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"}, {"name": "Changqing Li", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences"}], "title": "Detection of GB virus C/hepatitis G markers in Chinese voluntary blood donors", "abstract": "", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309e3a1a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zongkui Wang", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"}, {"name": "Xi Du", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"}, {"name": "Changqing Li", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"}, {"name": "Pan Sun", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"}, {"name": "Haijun Cao", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"}, {"name": "Fangzhao Lin", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"}, {"name": "Shengliang Ye", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"}, {"name": "Xiaopu Xiao", "org": "Institute of Blood Transfusion, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College"}], "title": "Coagulation factors and inhibitors in thawed plasma stored at 1-6\u00b0C for 5days in China", "abstract": "Introduction: Many transfusion services are keeping thawed plasma (TP) ready for trauma patients. According to Chinese guidelines, once thawed, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should be used within 24. h. This may increase plasma wastage and delay plasma administration to critical patients. However, it can be avoided by being relabeled as TP. In this study we evaluated coagulation-related proteins in thawed apheresis FFP during 5. days of storage at 1-6. \u00b0C. Materials and methods: Thirty apheresis fresh plasma units were aliquot and stored at -70. \u00b0C. Aliquots were thawed at 37. \u00b0C and stored at 1-6. \u00b0C for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. days, respectively. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen (Fbg), factor (F) II, FV, FVII, FVIII, FIX, FX, FXI, FXII, protein C (PC), protein S (PS), antithrombin III (ATIII) and ADAMTS13 levels were assessed at Days 0-5, respectively. Results: For 5. days of refrigerated storage, no significant differences were observed in Fbg, PC, PS, ATIII and ADAMTS13. FII, FV, FVII, FVIII, FIX, FX, FXI and FXII declined significantly over time. The storage presented major decrease for FVIII, with a drop of 40%. However, at least 60% levels of all measured proteins were remained on Day 5, when compared to Day 0. Conclusion: All measured proteins in TP for 5. days of refrigerated storage were adequate. These could provide evidence that thawed FFP could be relabeled as TP, which is a potential to ensure rapid plasma availability in emergency situations in China. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.", "keywords": ["Coagulation factors", "Coagulation inhibitors", "Plasma storage", "Thawed plasma"], "venue": "Transfusion and Apheresis Science", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309c7227"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xin L\u00fc", "org": "Department of Microbiology, Fourth Military Medical University"}, {"name": "Min Yao", "org": "Department of Microbiology, Fourth Military Medical University"}, {"name": "Jian-Min Zhang", "org": "Department of Microbiology, Fourth Military Medical University"}, {"name": "Jing Yang", "org": "Department of Microbiology, Fourth Military Medical University"}, {"name": "Ying-Feng Lei", "org": "Department of Microbiology, Fourth Military Medical University"}, {"name": "Xiao-Jun Huang", "org": "Department of Microbiology, Fourth Military Medical University"}, {"name": "Zhan-Sheng Jia", "org": "Center of Diagnosis and Treatment for Infectious Disease of Chinese PLA, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Center of Diagnosis and Treatment for Infectious Disease of Chinese PLA, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University"}, {"name": "Hai-Yun Lan", "org": "Department of Microbiology, Fourth Military Medical University"}, {"name": "Zhi-Kai Xu", "org": "Department of Microbiology, Fourth Military Medical University"}, {"name": "Wen Yin", "org": "Department of Microbiology, Fourth Military Medical University"}], "title": "Identification of peptides that bind hepatitis C virus envelope protein E2 and inhibit viral cellular entry from a phage-display peptide library", "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope protein E2 is required for the entry of HCV into cells.

The current study was performed to determine the impact of polysomy 17 on the interpretation of HER2 testing of invasive breast carcinomas. Methods: Chromosome 17 copies and HER2 gene status were identified by fluorescent in situ hybridization in 384 cases with invasive breast cancer, and the corresponding HER2 expression was obtained by immunohistochemistry stain. Results: The average CEP17 copy number for the group was 2.1 (range, 1.0-12.4). Forty-eight cases (13.8%, 48/348) were identified as chromosome 17 polysomy with CEP 17 copy number \u2265 3.

Methods: First, a remnant kidney model was established in rats and the expression of HA was determined using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting. Next, chemotaxis assay using flow cytometry, and cell migration assay of MSCs were performed in vitro. Then, MSCs were transplanted into rats, thus, sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into sham group, 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6 Nx) group, MSC group and MSC/Anti-CD44 group (n = 8 for all groups). Migration of MSCs to the kidney in these rats was assessed by using cell tracking experiments, and tissue damage was evaluated by morphological analysis using Masson's trichrome staining and periodic acid Schiff staining. Results: HA was significantly observed in 5/6 Nx group, but not in sham group. Meanwhile, HA was discovered induced MSCs migration remarkably (p < 0.05) and anti-CD44 antibody inhibited the migration significantly (p < 0.05) in vitro. In vivo, the GFP-MSCs were observed in MSC group and the cells reduced in MSC/Anti-CD44 groups, especially, in the tubulointerstitium. Conclusion: Our findings reveal that CD44-HA has the potential to induce MSCs homing to injured tissue, while its effect on the ability of MSCs, improving tissue function, is not significant. \u00a9 2014 S.

VSMC phenotype change is a prerequisite of migration. RhoA and Rho-kinase (ROCK) mediate migration of VSMCs. We hypothesize that ADMA induces VSMC migration via the activation of Rho/ROCK signal pathway and due to VSMCs phenotype change. ADMA activates Rho/ROCK signal pathway that interpreted by the elevation of RhoA activity and phosphorylation level of a ROCK substrate. Pretreatment with ROCK inhibitor, Y27632 completely reverses the induction of ADMA on ROCK and in turn inhibits ADMA-induced VSMCs migration. When the Rho/ROCK signal pathway has been blocked by pretreatment with Y27632, the induction of ERK signal pathway by ADMA is completely abrogated. Elimination of ADMA via overexpression of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 2 (DDAH2) and L-arginine both blocks the effects of ADMA on the activation of Rho/ROCK and extra cellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in VSMCs. The expression of differentiated phenotype relative proteins was reduced and the actin cytoskeleton was disassembled by ADMA, which were blocked by Y27632, further interpreting that ADMA inducing VSMCs migration via Rho/ROCK signal pathway is due to its effect on the VSMCs phenotype change.

Forty Beagle dogs with intubation of the carotid artery and jugular vein 24 hours before the injury were subjected to 50% TBSA full-thickness burns, and were randomly divided into following four groups: no resuscitation group (group NR), venous fluid resuscitation group (group R), PNU-282987 treatment group (group P), and fluid resuscitation group plus PNU-282987 group (group RP), with 10 dogs in each group. Hemodynamic variables and biochemical parameters were determined with animals in a conscious and cooperative state. The plasma volume and the vasopermeability were determined by indocyanine green and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran, respectively. The level of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2 in plasma, and the water content of different organs were also determined. The mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and plasma volume of all dogs decreased significantly, and the lung extravascular water index and pulmonary vascular permeability index increased remarkably after burn. The hemodynamic parameters deteriorated continually in group N dogs, and then anuria, hyperlactacidemia, and multiple organ dysfunctions developed. The mean arterial pressure and cardiac output of dogs in group R and group RP returned to preinjury levels at 48 hours postburn. The lung extravascular water index and pulmonary vascular permeability in group R were higher than those before preinjury. The dogs in group RP were found to have a significant increase in plasma volume and urine output, and a remarkable decrease in the levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b1, lactic acid, and organ functions compared with those of group R (P <.05). The survival rate of RP group (100%; 10/10) was significantly higher than that of group N (0; 0/10), group P (20%; 2/10), and group R (60%; 6/10). PNU-282987 combined with intravenous fluid resuscitation significantly improved hemodynamics and the survival rate in the early period after this lethal burn shock. The mechanism may be attributable to the lowering of the level of proinflammatory mediators, amelioration of vasopermeability-induced visceral edema, less of blood volume loss, and protection of vital organs through activation of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. \u00a9 2013 by the American Burn Association.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Journal of Burn Care and Research", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309e7107"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yong-Wang Li", "org": "Department of Anesthesiology, Second Artillery General Hospital of PLA"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Second Artillery General Hospital of PLA"}, {"name": "Bo Sui", "org": "Department of Anesthesiology, Second Artillery General Hospital of PLA"}, {"name": "Cai-Hong Cao", "org": "Department of Anesthesiology, Second Artillery General Hospital of PLA"}, {"name": "Xiang-Dong Liu", "org": "Department of Anesthesiology, Second Artillery General Hospital of PLA"}], "title": "Etomidate with or without flumazenil anesthesia for stem cell transplantation in autistic children", "abstract": "Background: The aim of this study was to investigate etomidate administration with or without flumazenil in autistic children who underwent intrathecal transplantation of stem cells by lumbar puncture. Methods: Forty autistic children aged 2-12, who were scheduled for stem cell transplantation via lumbar puncture under anesthesia, were randomized for a double-blind study. The children were randomly assigned to two groups: the flumazenil group (group F, n=20) and the etomidate group (group E, n=20). All children received 0.2 mg/kg of etomidate. In the case of inadequate anesthesia, patients received repeated doses of 0.1 mg/kg of etomidate until reaching deep sedation. After operation, children in group F were given flumazenil (0.01 mg/kg) and children in group E received placebo. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, the Ramsay sedation score (RSS), and recovery time of all children were continuously monitored and recorded during the entire procedure. Results: After anesthesia, blood pressure and HR measurements were not significantly changed in both groups compared with the baseline. There were no respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, nausea, and vomiting. Five patients complained of pain on the site of injection. Myoclonus occurred in seven patients. Recovery time in group F was significantly shorter than in group E (p<0.001), and after the injection of flumazenil, RSS in group F significantly decreased than in group E. There were no significant differences in operation time. Physician satisfaction in both groups was similar. Conclusions: Etomidate resulted in stable hemodynamic responses and relatively less adverse effects, and flumazenil antagonized the anesthetic effect of etomidate; thus, etomidate with flumazenil is suitable for performing stem cell transplantation in autistic children. \u00a9 2014 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston 2014.", "keywords": ["Autism", "Etomidate", "Flumazenil", "Stem cell transplantation"], "venue": "Drug Metabolism and Drug Interactions", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309eaefd"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiaohui Bian", "org": "Department of Nephrology"}, {"name": "Beiru Zhang", "org": "Department of Nephrology"}, {"name": "Wei Guo", "org": "Fourth Hospital of People"}, {"name": "Na Liu", "org": "Department of Nephrology"}, {"name": "Yu Bai", "org": "Department of Nephrology"}, {"name": "Jianing Miao", "org": "Key Laboratory of Health Ministry for Congenital Malformation"}, {"name": "Guifeng Zhao", "org": "Key Laboratory of Health Ministry for Congenital Malformation"}, {"name": "Bo Liu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Health Ministry for Congenital Malformation"}, {"name": "Shubao Wang", "org": "Key Laboratory of Health Ministry for Congenital Malformation"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Infectious Diseases"}, {"name": "Liqiang Zheng", "org": "Library Department"}, {"name": "Yueyang Zhao", "org": "Library Department"}, {"name": "Detian Li", "org": "Department of Nephrology"}, {"name": "Jiangmin Feng", "org": "Department of Nephrology"}], "title": "Effects of mesenchyma", "abstract": "Aims: The optimal time for mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) transplantation remains an unresolved issue.

The authors have previously shown that valproic acid (VPA) improves survival in a dog burn model. The aim of this study is to examine whether a VPA improves survival in a rodent burn model and whether this was because of inhibition of cell apoptosis. Rats were subjected to third-degree 55% TBSA burns and randomized to treatment with a VPA (300 mg/kg) or normal saline. One group of animals was monitored for 12 hours for survival analysis; another group was killed at 6 hours after injury, and brains, hearts, and blood samples were harvested for examination. Plasma creatine kinase (CK)-MB activities and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels were measured to evaluate the cardiac and brain damages. The effects of a VPA on acetylation of histone H3 and caspase-3 activation were also evaluated. Major burn injury resulted in a significant decrease in the acetylation of histone H3, and there was an increase in plasma CK-MB activities, NSE concentrations, and tissue levels of activated caspase-3. A VPA treatment significantly increased the acetylation of histone H3 and survival of the animals after major burn injury. In addition, a VPA treatment significantly attenuated the plasma CK-MB activities, an NSE concentrations, and inhibited caspase-3 activation after major burn injury. These results indicate that a VPA can attenuate cardiac and brain injury, and can improve survival in a rodent model of lethal burn injury. These protective effects may be mediated in part through the inhibition of caspase-3 activation. \u00a9 2013 by the American Burn Association.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Journal of Burn Care and Research", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309c4aea"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yusen Hou", "org": "Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, PLA General Hospital"}, {"name": "Jiake Chai", "org": "Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, PLA General Hospital"}, {"name": "Lingying Liu", "org": "Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, PLA General Hospital"}, {"name": "Yonghui Yu", "org": "Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, PLA General Hospital"}, {"name": "Hongjie Duan", "org": "Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, PLA General Hospital"}, {"name": "Quan Hu", "org": "Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, PLA General Hospital"}, {"name": "Wanli Chu", "org": "Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, PLA General Hospital"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Burn and Plastic Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital, PLA General Hospital"}], "title": "Effects of lipopolysaccharide pretreatment on endotoxin tolerance of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells", "abstract": "Objective: To explore the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pretreatment on endotoxin tolerance of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) and its possible mechanism.

The purpose of our study is to explore the relationship between cancer stem cells (CSCs) marked by CD133 and KAI1/CD82 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC).Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis was used to detect the expression of CD133 and KAI1/CD82 in 83 archival surgical specimens of human LSCC and 83 cases of normal laryngeal tissues.Results: In LSCC, positive rates of 49.4% and 41.0% were obtained for CD133 and KAI1/CD82, respectively. The expression of CD133 in LSCC tissues was significantly higher than that in normal tissues (P < 0.001), and the expression of CD133 was positively associated with pTNM stage (P = 0.005), pathological grade (P = 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001). The reduced expression of KAI1/CD82 was present in LSCC tissues. The positive rate of KAI1/CD82 expression was negatively correlated with pTNM stage (P = 0.014), pathological grade (P < 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.007). A correlation analysis showed that there was a negative relationship between the expression of CD133 and KAI1/CD82 protein in LSCC tissues (P < 0.001). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the expression of CD133 was negatively correlated with overall survival (OS) (log-rank = 40.949, P < 0.001) and disease-free survival (DFS) (log-rank = 39.307, P < 0.001) time of LSCC.

Cox regression analysis: the expression of CD133 and KAI1/CD82, and pTNM stages were independent prognostic factors of LSCC (P < 0.05).Conclusions: Thus the detection of CD133 and KAI1/CD82 proteins may be used as a potential indicator of LSCC prognosis. \u00a9 2014 Yu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "World Journal of Surgical Oncology", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309d77cc"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Binghong Xiong", "org": "Department of General Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Internal Medicine, Chongqing Huaxi Hospital"}, {"name": "Caiquan Zhang", "org": "Department of General Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"}, {"name": "Yong Cheng", "org": "Department of General Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"}], "title": "Robotic versus laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer: A meta-analysis", "abstract": "Background Robotic surgery has been used successfully in many branches of surgery; but there is little evidence in the literature on its use in rectal cancer (RC). We conducted this meta-analysis that included randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized controlled trials of robotic total mesorectal excision (RTME) versus laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LTME) to evaluate whether the safety and efficacy of RTME in patients with RC are equivalent to those of LTME. Materials and methods Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Ovid, and Web of Science databases were searched. Studies clearly documenting a comparison of RTME with LTME for RC were selected. Operative and recovery outcomes, early postoperative morbidity, and oncological parameters were evaluated. Results Eight studies were identified that included 1229 patients in total, 554 (45.08%) in the RTME and 675 (54.92%) in the LTME. Meta-analysis suggested that the conversion rate to open surgery in RTME was significantly lower than in LTME (P = 0.0004). There were no significant differences in operation time, estimated blood loss, recovery outcome, postoperative morbidity and mortality, length of hospital stay, and the oncological accuracy of resection and local recurrence between the two groups. The positive rate of circumferential resection margins (P = 0.04) and the incidence of erectile dysfunction (P = 0.002) were lower in RTME compared with LTME. Conclusions RTME for RC is safe and feasible, and the short- and medium-term oncological and functional outcomes are equivalent or preferable to LTME. It may be an alternative treatment for RC. More multicenter randomized controlled trials investigating the long-term oncological and functional outcomes are required to determine the advantages of RTME over LTME in RC. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we investigated the correlation between the tumor grade and prognostic biomarkers with the ADC in glioma patients. Eighty-two patients with supratentorial glioma were identified via analysis of surgical specimens and neuroradiological data. Using the World Health Organization grade, histological subtype, and molecular variants (1p/19q codeletion, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 mutation, Ki-67 index, O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase, P53, and vascular endothelial growth factor immunoactivity) as prognostic biomarkers, we performed receiver operating characteristic analysis and multiple linear regression to assess the association between the magnetic resonance diffusion parameter and mean ADC and the prognostic factors of glioma pathology. Univariate analysis and multiple linear regression revealed inverse correlations between the ADC values and the tumor grade, oligodendrocytoma histology, and 1p/19q codeletion. A threshold mean ADC value could predict the 1p/19q chromosomal status in WHO II gliomas with 72 % sensitivity and 88 % specificity (area under the curve 0.82, 95 % confidence interval 0.68-0.97) and could distinguish low-grade glioma with low-risk factors from the high-risk group (P < 0.01).

Epigenetic modifications enable differentiated cells to perpetuate molecular memory to retain their identity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the reprogramming modification of yak fibroblast cells that were permeabilized and incubated in the extracts of mesenchymal stem cells derived from mice adipose tissue [adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs)]. According to the results, the treatment of ADSC extracts promoted colony formation. Moreover, pluripotent gene expression was associated with the loss of repressive histone modifications and increased global demethylation. The genes Col1a1 and Col1a2, which are typically found in differentiated cells only, demonstrated decreased expression and increased methylation in the 5\u2032-flanking regulatory regions. Moreover, yak fibroblast cells that were exposed to ADSC extracts resulted in significantly different eight-cell and blastocyst formation rates of cloned embryos compared with their untreated counterparts. This investigation provides the first evidence that nuclear reprogramming of yak fibroblast cells is modified after the ADSC extract treatment. This research also presents a methodology for studying the dedifferentiation of somatic cells that can potentially lead to an efficient way of reprogramming somatic cells toward a pluripotent state without genetic alteration.

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the clinical, pathological and prognostic characteristics of GEP-NENs in China.Methods: We collected clinical and pathological data of 168 patients diagnosed with GEP-NENs and treated at the First and Second Affiliated Hospitals of Dalian Medical University between January 2003 and December 2012. Kaplan-Meier method and log rank analysis was used to analyze the prognostic significance of clinical and pathological characteristics.Results: Mean age was 51.83 \u00b1 14.03 and the male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1. Primary sites were the rectum (58.93%), pancreas (13.69%), stomach (9.52%), duodenum (5.36%), colon (4.76%), appendix (4.76%), ileum (2.38%) and jejunum (0.60%). Most patients (95.83%) presented non-functional tumors with non-specific symptoms such as abdominal or back pain (29.17%) and gastrointestinal bleeding (25.60%). Based on the 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, patients were diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumor (NET) (24.40%) or neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) (7.14%).

In accordance to TCM patterns, our ancestors created many pertinent TCM formulae, which have been used in China for thousands of years and are still playing an important role in China today. However, the biological mechanism of TCM pattern-specific formulae remains elusive. In this paper, we chose CHD patterns (Qi-stagnation induced blood-stasis syndrome, abbreviated as QSB; Qi-deficiency induced blood-stasis syndrome, abbreviated as QDB) as examples to illustrate the mechanism of their pattern-specific formulae. Using entity grammar systems (EGS) formalism, we built two pharmacologic networks of the formulae and obtained the intersection and difference networks by network comparison. Then we analyzed their common and different mechanisms for treating CHD by GO enrichment analysis. The results indicate that QDB-specific formula takes more special molecular paths to treat CHD, which contribute to more severe pathological changes in comparison with QSB.

Several advanced imaging modalities have been developed to differentiate between these two entities with disparate outcomes. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic quality of diffusion MRI in differentiating glioma recurrence from radiation necrosis. Method PubMed, Embase and Chinese Biomedical databases were systematically searched to identify published articles about evaluation of diffusion MRI for the differential diagnosis of glioma recurrence from radiation necrosis. Pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated. Results Nine studies involving 284 patients (288 lesions) met all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quantitative synthesis of studies showed that the pooled weighted values were determined to be SEN: 0.82 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.87); SPE: 0.84 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.91); PLR: 5.10 (95% CI: 3.27, 7.95); NLR: 0.21 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.29); and DOR: 23.90 (95% CI: 12.44, 45.89).

Objective: To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of testosterone in severely burned rats. Methods: Severe burn injuries were induced by immersing the back of the rat in 100-C water for 12 s. Rats were treated for 14 days with vehicle (burn group) or a physiological replacement dose of testosterone (B + T group) immediately after injury. Gene and protein expressions were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Results: Testosterone improved glucose metabolism, reduced body weight loss, and attenuated tibialis anterior muscle mass loss and muscle protein breakdown. In rat tibialis anterior muscle, testosterone positively regulated the insulin-sensitive glucose transporters Glut3 and Glut4 genes and glycogen synthase 1 protein. These changes would be expected to improve glucose metabolism and nutrient availability in skeletal muscle. Administration of testosterone negatively regulated atrogin 1 (Fbxo32) by increasing total and phosphorylated Foxo3a (forkhead-box transcription factor 3a) levels and positively regulated the expression of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream proteins p70S6 and S6 through mTORYextracellular signalYregulated kinase phosphorylation.

HPAM with molecular weight of 20 million lowered FS adsorption on montmorillonite more obviously than that with molecular weight of 10 million. With the increase of pH, the adsorption capacity on montmorillonite of the FS decreased. FS adsorption on montmorillonite could be increased in acidic environments, but FS adsorption on montmorillonite could be decreased in alkaline environments. As temperature increased, the adsorption capacity on montmorillonite of the FS first increased and then decreased, with the maximum adsorption capacity at 40-50\u00b0C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) of montmorillonite treated with the FS indicated that the FS entered the clay, and increased the layer spacing of MMT. \u00a9 All Rights Reserved.", "keywords": ["Absorbance", "Adsorption", "Fluorocarbon surfactant", "Montmorillonite", "X-ray diffraction"], "venue": "Huagong Xuebao/CIESC Journal", "year": 2011, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309b94ed"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "College of Chemical Engineering"}, {"name": "Xing-Qi Qiu", "org": "College of Chemical Engineering"}, {"name": "Jian Wang", "org": "Beijing Petroleum Chemical Engineering Co., Ltd."}, {"name": "Zhi-Wei Zheng", "org": "College of Chemical Engineering"}, {"name": "Zhi-Yong Yi", "org": "College of Chemical Engineering"}, {"name": "Hong-Qiao Yang", "org": "College of Chemical Engineering"}], "title": "Experimental research on single droplet evaporation factors", "abstract": "Droplet evaporation equipment is founded.

A bank of spatial filters, whose kernels are suitable for iris recognition, is then used to capture local characteristics of the iris so as to produce discriminating texture features. Experimental results show that the proposed method has an encouraging performance. In particular, a comparative study of existing methods for iris recognition is conducted on an Iris image database Including 2,255 sequences from 213 subjects. Conclusions based on such a comparison using a nonparametric statistical method (the bootstrap) provide useful Information for further research.", "keywords": ["Biometrics", "Image quality assessment", "Iris recognition", "Multichannel spatial filters", "Texture analysis"], "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "year": 2003, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309dc121"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Natl.

This leads to its high reliability for personal identification, and at the same time, the difficulty in effectively representing such details in an image. This paper describes an efficient algorithm for iris recognition by characterizing key local variations. The basic idea is that local sharp variation points, denoting the appearing or vanishing of an important image structure, are utilized to represent the characteristics of the iris. The whole procedure of feature extraction includes two steps: 1) a set of one-dimensional intensity signals is constructed to effectively characterize the most important information of the original two-dimensional image; 2) using a particular class of wavelets, a position sequence of local sharp variation points in such signals is recorded as features. We also present a fast matching scheme based on exclusive OR operation to compute the similarity between a pair of position sequences. Experimental results on 2255 iris images show that the performance of the proposed method is encouraging and comparable to the best iris recognition algorithm found in the current literature.", "keywords": ["Biometrics", "Iris recognition", "Local sharp variations", "Personal identification", "Transient signal analysis", "Wavelet transform"], "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "year": 2004, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309ad757"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Natl.

It is impossible to acidify soils that have high contents of calcium carbonate in south Florida. Replacing calcareous soils with acidic soils obtained from distant regions is an alternative. Unfortunately, such introduced acidic soils may eventually be neutralized by irrigation and ground water that is saturated with calcium carbonate. The objective of this investigation was to examine the acidity changes and buffering capacities of three types of acidic soils (silica sand soil, red loamy sand soil, and a mixed soil) used to establish tropical plants in a rainforest exhibition at Fairchild Tropical Garden, Miami, FL. The three areas were excavated to remove native calcareous soil, limestone bedrock, and filled with acidic soils. Various rainforest plants were planted. Soil samples were collected in contiguous 10 cm-deep segments from the soil surface to the bedrock shortly after deposition of the soils and one year later. Soil pH, EC, particle distribution, buffering capacity were determined. Results showed that both silica sand and mixed soils had been neutralized and the soil pH values had risen over 7 in all soil depths after one year. However, less than 10 cm of the surface and bottom soil layers of red loamy sand had been neutralized and the soil pH in the middle of soil profile remained unchanged due to its higher buffering capacity. A column leaching study showed that the acidity in the red loamy sand soil would be neutralized by irrigation water and by capillary movement of groundwater with a high concentration of calcium bicarbonate. Buffering curves indicate that it is easier to maintain acidity in sandy soil than of loamy sand and mixed soils with acidified irrigation water.

Significant variations in the vertical distribution of the nutrients were found in the soil profiles due to the soils being at different ripening stages. The typical characteristics of these Fimic Anthrosols were great accumulation of organic matter, intensive enrichment of available phosphorus and high intensity of microbial activity.

Heavy metal analyses and correlation relationships suggested that Zn, Pb and Cu are the main contaminant elements in Fimic Anthrosols and in vegetable-cultivated soils with different ripening stages.

Diabetes was induced in rats by streptozotocin and diabetic rats were divided into two groups: (i) an Scu-treated group, administered 0.1g/kg Scu by gavage; and (ii) an aminoquanidine (AG)-treated group, which received dietary supplementation of 0.1% AG from Week 1 of diabetes induction. After 10weeks, rats were killed and thoracic aortic smooth muscle cells were isolated and cultured. Cell fractions were obtained by ultracentrifugation and PKC activity was assayed by ELISA, whereas the distribution of PKC was verified by western immunoblotting. The PKC activity in the membrane fraction of thoracic aortic smooth muscle cells was significantly increased in diabetic compared with control rats, whereas the administration of Scu significantly inhibited this increase. Phorbol myristate acetate (100nmol/L, 10min) induced the translocation of the PKC\u03b1, \u03b2I, \u03b2II, \u03b4 and \u03b5 isoforms, whereas 48h pretreatment of cells with 1\u03bcmol/L Scu significantly inhibited PMA-induced PKC\u03b2I, \u03b2II and \u03b4 translocation.

In this study, the expression of Cldn2 in the epithelial layer of mice and patients with food allergy was observed by immunohistochemistry. The induction of Cldn2 was carried out with a cell culture model. The Cldn2-facilitated antigen internalization was observed by confocal microscopy. The epithelial barrier function in the gut epithelial monolayer was assessed by recording the transepithelial resistance and assessing the permeability to a macromolecular tracer. The results showed that the positive immune staining of Cldn2 was observed in the epithelial layer of the small intestine that was weakly stained in na\u00efve control mice, and strongly stained in sensitized mice as well as patients with food allergy. Exposure to cholera toxin or Staphylococcal enterotoxin B induced the expression of Cldn2 in HT-29 or T84 cells. Cldn2 could bind protein antigen to form complexes to facilitate the antigen transport across the epithelial barrier. Blocking Cldn2 prevented the allergen-related hypersensitivity the intestine.

A long range geoacoustic inversion experiment was conducted in January 2005, in winter conditions in the South China Sea where the bottom is mostly sand and silt. In this experiment, single frequency CW pulse signals were transmitted from a suspended source, and received by a vertical array of hydrophones. The data were inverted for the geoacoustic properties of the seabed using a hybrid inversion method-the adaptive simplex simulated annealing (ASSA). Owing to the identical inversion procedures, the favorable results were obtained for 6 unknown geometrical and geoacoustic parameters by the semi-infinite seabed model. It is shown that seabed inversion parameters are consistent for the different time arrival signals. By comparing with the inversion for a sediment over basement bottom model, the single layer seabed geoacoustic model is adequate to obtain the equivalent seabed parameters very well for the long range experiment site.

Using positional cloning, we here identify mutations in the gene CEP290 as causing nephronophthisis. It encodes a protein with several domains also present in CENPF, a protein involved in chromosome segregation. CEP290 (also known as NPHP6) interacts with and modulates the activity of ATF4, a transcription factor implicated in cAMP-dependent renal cyst formation. NPHP6 is found at centrosomes and in the nucleus of renal epithelial cells in a cell cycle-dependent manner and in connecting cilia of photoreceptors. Abrogation of its function in zebrafish recapitulates the renal, retinal and cerebellar phenotypes of Joubert syndrome.

Microtubules in turn enhance assembly of the matrix. Here we report that the isolated matrix contains known spindle assembly factors such as dynein and Nudel. Using spindle assembly assays in Xenopus egg extracts, we show that Nudel regulates microtubule organization during spindle assembly independently of its function at kinetochores. Importantly, Nudel interacts directly with lamin B to facilitate the accumulation and assembly of lamin-B-containing matrix on microtubules in a dynein-dependent manner. Perturbing either Nudel or dynein inhibited the assembly of lamin B matrix. However, depleting lamin B still allowed the formation of matrices containing dynein and Nudel. Therefore, dynein and Nudel regulate assembly of the lamin B matrix. Interestingly, we found that whereas depleting lamin B resulted in disorganized spindle and spindle poles, disrupting the function of Nudel or dynein caused a complete lack of spindle pole focusing. We suggest that Nudel regulates microtubule organization in part by facilitating assembly of the lamin B spindle matrix in a dynein-dependent manner.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Nature Cell Biology", "year": 2009, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309bd1f9"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yingzi Ying", "org": "Institute of Acoustics"}, {"name": "Shengming Guo", "org": "Institute of Acoustics"}, {"name": "Bingwen Sun", "org": "Institute of Acoustics"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Institute of Acoustics"}, {"name": "Zhenghua Cai", "org": "Institute of Acoustics"}, {"name": "Huamin Fu", "org": "Institute of Acoustics"}, {"name": "Bing Hu", "org": "Institute of Acoustics"}], "title": "Experimental investigation of bottom target detection by single channel iterative time reversal", "abstract": "Iterative time reversal process will gradually lead echo waves to converge to a dominant narrowband resonant mode of the target and enhance the return level in noisy and reverberant environment.

This study continues an investigation of monochromatic signal from the two south and east propagation tracks. This paper only gives one track's result. On this track, internal waves led to acoustic modes coupling.

It led to acoustic field energy appeared strong fluctuation at almost every receiving depth. The peak to peak value of energy fluctuations exceeded 20 dB. Acoustic fluctuations between upper receiving depths and lower receiving depths were opposite. Fluctuation phasic difference of upper and lower depths was about 180 degree.

On the one hand, the economy system explored and processed resources from natural system, and discharged pollutants back to the natural system. On the other hand, natural ecological environment system provides resources and space for social economy activities, and feeds back with the natural disaster or environmental pollution. It is important to explore the relationship between economic development and environmental pollution. Given more existing researches focusing on the time scale, it is necessary to carry out the quantitative assessment research on the interaction between economic sub-system with environmental sub-system on the spatial scale. In this paper, the comprehensive assessment indicators for regional social economy system and environment system were constructed firstly. Then, the coupling degree and coordinating degree between regional economic development and environmental pollution was calculated. Based on the research on spatial patterns of coupling and coordinating degree of 350 prefectural units, it can be found that the economic and environment development in most prefectural units are still at a lower level of coupling and coordination. There are significant disparities in coupling and coordinating degree between eastern coastal areas and western inner areas. According to the coupling and coordinating value, Chinese territory could be divided into four types, i.e., economy-environment harmonious area, economy-environment gearing area, economy-environment rivaling area and low coupling degree of economy-environment area. Based on the industrial sector structure analysis of four types of area, it can be found that there is a spatial corresponding relationship between the regional industrial sector structure and the coupling-coordinating level. In the economy-environment harmonious area, high-level manufacturing industries of electrical machinery, electronic equipments account for major proportion in total industrial output value. As for economy-environment gearing area, its industrial value is concentrated on manufacture of machinery and equipment and a few polluting departments such as metallurgy, chemical industry and production of electric power. Economy-environment rivaling area is the agglomerating area of polluting industrial sectors, such as iron and steel industry, petrifaction industry, mining of coals, building material industry and production electric power.

For slower wind speeds, the relevant bubble density is not as narrowly constrained in depth, and this assumption is no longer reasonable.

In the nkx6.1/nkx6.2 morphants, co-injection of wnt1 or dngsk3\u03b2 mRNA, which activates Wnt signaling, rescues the expression of en2. Nkx6.1 and Nkx6.2 activate canonical Wnt signaling in reporter assays in both cultured mammalian cells and Xenopus embryos. An Nkx6.2 deletion construct, which inhibits the ability of wild type Nkx6.2 to activate Wnt signaling, also reduces the MHB expression of en2 in Xenopus embryos. These results suggest that Nkx6.1 and Nkx6.2 are involved in MHB formation in Xenopus embryos, likely by modulating wnt1 expression. \u00a9 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "keywords": ["mid-hindbrain boundary", "nkx6.1", "nkx6.2", "wnt1", "Xenopus"], "venue": "Development Genes and Evolution", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309c5b78"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Ling Tian", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Key Laboratory of Insect Developmental and Evolutionary Biology"}, {"name": "Enen Guo", "org": "Laboratory of Insect Molecular Biology and Biotechnology"}, {"name": "Xiaojuan Deng", "org": "Laboratory of Insect Molecular Biology and Biotechnology"}, {"name": "Sanyuan Ma", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology"}, {"name": "Qingyou Xia", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Silkworm Genome Biology"}, {"name": "Yang Cao", "org": "Laboratory of Insect Molecular Biology and Biotechnology"}, {"name": "Sheng Li", "org": "Key Laboratory of Insect Developmental and Evolutionary Biology"}], "title": "20-hydroxyecdysone upregulates Atg genes to induce autophagy in the Bombyx fat body", "abstract": "Autophagy is finely regulated at multiple levels and plays crucial roles in development and disease.

We designed and screened one pair of ZFN to target the highly conserved HIV-1 5\u2032-LTR and 3\u2032-LTR DNA sequences, named ZFN-LTR. We found that ZFN-LTR can specifically target and cleave the full-length HIV-1 proviral DNA in several infected and latently infected cell types and also HIV-1 infected human primary cells in vitro. We observed that the frequency of excision was 45.9% in infected human cell lines after treatment with ZFN-LTR, without significant host-cell genotoxicity. Taken together, our data demonstrate that a single ZFN-LTR pair can specifically and effectively cleave integrated full-length HIV-1 proviral DNA and mediate antiretroviral activity in infected and latently infected cells, suggesting that this strategy could offer a novel approach to eradicate the HIV-1 virus from the infected host in the future. \u00a9 2013 The Author(s).", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Nucleic Acids Research", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309cc5cc"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Liang-Shun Han", "org": ""}, {"name": "Hong-Liang Zhu", "org": ""}, {"name": "Can Zhang", "org": ""}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": ""}, {"name": "Song Liang", "org": ""}, {"name": "Wei Wang", "org": ""}], "title": "Temperature characteristics of monolithically integrated wavelength-selectable light sources", "abstract": "The temperature characteristics of monolithically integrated wavelength-selectable light sources are experimentally investigated.

The study identified the following results. (1) The 31 province-level regions fall into six categories: only one region is in the category of sharp over-urbanization, 3 regions are in medium over-urbanization, 11 slight over-urbanization, 8 basic coordination, one medium under-urbanization, and seven slight under-urbanization.

To explore the effects of protective methods on soil and nutrient losses from sloping arable land, rainfall runoff plot experiment was conducted from May 2010 to May 2011. Materials and methods: For a rotation of wheat and maize, four treatments with three replicates were set up: H1, planting Vetiveria zizanioides contour hedgerows; H2, planting alfalfa contour hedgerows; H3, wheat intercropped with horsebean and maize intercropped with soybean, reduced tillage, and ridge furrow cultivation; and H4, conventional management. Nitrogen and phosphorus losses via surface and subsurface runoff were analyzed. Results and discussion: When compared with that in H4, sediment phosphorus losses from plots of H1, H2, and H3 were significantly reduced by 46.61, 30.51, and 37.29%, respectively, while surface runoff total phosphorus loss was reduced by 45.38, 28.46, and 34.62%, respectively. Sediment nitrogen and surface runoff total nitrogen losses were not reduced significantly. Sediments were highly enriched with organic matter and nutrients, and decaying organic matter from plant residuals contributed to sediment nitrogen and phosphorus losses. Conclusions: In sandy loam sloping arable land, contour hedgerows and ridge furrow cultivation were effective in reducing phosphorus loss via surface runoff. However, subsurface runoff is the primary path for nutrient losses, especially for nitrogen loss. Accordingly, attention should be given to improve the management of fertilizer nutrients, soil water, and plant residuals in sandy loam slope land. \u00a9 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "keywords": ["Contour hedgerows", "Nitrogen and phosphorus losses", "Reduced tillage ridge and furrow cultivation", "Sandy loam slope land in the Three Gorges area"], "venue": "Journal of Soils and Sediments", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309d1ab9"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Z.D.

Commonly the bottom is characterized by geoacoustic (GA) parameters and nearly all the existing numerical codes for sound field prediction use the GA parameters as the input of the bottom. However, the GA parameters are model based (needs a specified layered bottom model to mount the parameters in) which in practical applications may cause a series of problems such as model mismatching, extra uncertainty for field prediction and time consuming in MFP inverting. When the two bottom reflective parameters (P, Q) are used instead of GA parameters, which are model-free and directly determine the effect of the bottom on the sound field respectively in phase and strength, those problems will be solved naturally. In this paper, for range-independent waveguide using (P, Q) directly as input to construct the Green's function in terms of normal mode field is fully developed. For range-dependent waveguide, we propose an effective-equivalence based mapping between the bottom reflective parameters (P, Q) and the effective half-space (EHS) GA parameters to make (P, Q) as input parameters indirectly. Then all the existed numerical codes can still be used for the calculation of sound field without any modification except using P and Q as the input parameters of the bottom. The accuracy of this mapping is verified for both range-independent and range-dependent waveguide. At last the uncertainty analysis in GA space as well as in PQ space is briefly discussed to reveal the \u00abextra uncertainty\u00bb due to the inter-coupling among the GA parameters. \u00a9 IMACS.", "keywords": ["Bottom effects", "Geoacoustic parameter", "Green's function", "Reflective parameter", "Waveguide"], "venue": "Journal of Computational Acoustics", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309e70d1"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhouying Song", "org": "Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Weidong Liu", "org": "Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Michael Dunford", "org": "School of Global Studies, University of Sussex"}], "title": "Measuring spatial differences of informatization in China", "abstract": "As the wide application of new Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) shows, the world is moving fast towards an information age.

Neither antiviral agents nor vaccines are available for efficiently combating viral infection. Study of EV71-host interplay is important for understanding viral infection and developing strategies for prevention and therapy. Here the interactions of EV71 with human dendritic cells were analyzed. Methods. EV71 capture, endocytosis, infection, and degradation in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) were detected by Flow cytometry or real-time (RT-) PCR, and MDDCs-mediated EV71 trans-infection of RD cells was determined via coculture system. Cell morphology or viability was monitored with microscopy or flow cytometry. SiRNA interference was used to knock down gene expression. Results: MDDCs can bind EV71, but these loaded-EV71 particles in MDDCs underwent a rapid degradation in the absence of efficient replication; once the captured EV71 encountered susceptible cells, MDDCs efficiently transferred surface-bound viruses to target cells. The molecule of DC-SIGN (DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing nonintegrin) mediated viral binding and transfer, because interference of DC-SIGN expression with specific siRNAs reduced EV71 binding and impaired MDDC-mediated viral trans-infection, and exogenous expression of DC-SIGN molecule on Raji cell initiated viral binding and subsequent transmission. Conclusion: MDDCs could bind efficiently EV71 viruses through viral binding to DC-SIGN molecule, and these captured-viruses could be transferred to susceptible cells for robust infection. The novel finding of DC-mediated EV71 dissemination might facilitate elucidation of EV71 primary infection and benefit searching for new clues for preventing viruses from initial infection. \u00a9 2014 Ren et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "keywords": ["Dendritic cells", "Enterovirus 71", "Viral trans-infection"], "venue": "Virology Journal", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309bf1a0"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yanbo Zhang", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Yao Lu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Xudong Cao", "org": "Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Soochow University"}, {"name": "Jun Xiao", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Jiexia Chen", "org": "The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University"}, {"name": "Shaozhuo Jiao", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Yunzhen Gao", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Chang Liu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Zhaojun Duan", "org": "National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, CHN CDC"}, {"name": "Dangsheng Li", "org": "Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences"}, {"name": "Yulong He", "org": "Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Soochow University"}, {"name": "Bin Wei", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Hongyan Wang", "org": "Cancer Research Center, Xu-Hui Central Hospital, Shanghai Clinical Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}], "title": "Activation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 in macrophages restrains TLR4-NF-\u03baB signaling and protects against endotoxin shock", "abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are critical in mediating innate immune responses against infections. However, uncontrolled TLR-triggered inflammation is associated with endotoxin shock. To better understand the homeostatic mechanisms induced by TLR4 signaling, we screened a group of key cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and their receptors forbacteria- or LPS-induced expression. The surfacevascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) and its ligand VEGF-C were upregulated in macrophages. VEGFR-3 ligation by VEGF-C significantly attenuated proinflammatory cytokine production. Notably, ablation of the ligand-binding domain or tyrosine kinase activity of VEGFR-3 rendered mice more sensitive to septic shock. VEGFR-3 restrained TLR4-NF-\u03baB activation by regulating the PI3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway and SOCS1 expression. Aside from targeting lymphatic vessels, we suggest a key role of VEGFR-3 on macrophages to prevent infections that is complicated with lymphoedema. Thus, VEGFR-3-VEGF-C signaling represents a \"self-control\" mechanism during antibacterial innate immunity. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Immunity", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309c3365"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Lin Su", "org": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustics Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Bing-Wen Sun", "org": "Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustics Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Sheng-Ming Guo", "org": "Key Laboratory of Underwater Acoustics Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}], "title": "Spatial filter design based on compressed replica vectors", "abstract": "Matched field processing techniques have been studied extensively in recent decades, and a lot of detail algorithms have been put forward for practical use.

In this paper, a scheme of optimizing spatial filter design based on the compressed replica vectors is presented, and the broadband data are processed incoherently. In contrary to the existing spatial filter, the optimized spatial filter can effectively reduce the computational complexity and memory usage when the number of array elements N is greater than the number of the effective modes Q, meanwhile, it also retains the original performance of interference suppression. Numerical simulations in a littoral shallow water environment are performed to validate the performance of the spatial filter and the promotion of computation speed. Then, data processing results obtained from an experiment conducted in the littoral shallow water environment are presented. It follows from the results that the weak underwater target can be distinguished from the strong surface interference clearly by use of the incoherent matched field processing with the application of the spatial filter based on compressed replica vectors. \u00a9 2014 Chinese Physical Society.", "keywords": ["Compressed replica vector", "Matched field processing", "Spatial filter"], "venue": "Wuli Xuebao/Acta Physica Sinica", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309ae40c"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Mingbo Qu", "org": "School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Dalian University of Technology"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Key Laboratory of Insect Developmental and Evolutionary Biology, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, {"name": "Peng Chen", "org": "School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Dalian University of Technology"}, {"name": "Qing Yang", "org": "School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Dalian University of Technology"}], "title": "Proteomic analysis of insect molting fluid with a focus on enzymes involved in chitin degradation", "keywords": ["chitin", "Chitinase", "chitinolytic enzymes", "cuticle", "insect", "molting", "proteomics"], "venue": "Journal of Proteome Research", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309c4359"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Qi-Qun Cheng", "org": "Key Laboratory of Marine and Estuarine Fisheries"}, {"name": "Da-Ru Lu", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering"}], "title": "Morphological differences between close populations discernible by multivariate analysis: A case study of genus Coilia (Teleostei: Clupeiforms)", "abstract": "In order to understand the morphological differences between four populations of genus Coilia (Teleostei: Clupeiforms) and identify them conveniently, truss network data were used to conduct multivariate analysis.

Methods: A retrospective PPT study was conducted. During the 7 years, 4957 patients attending for investigation of suspected photodermatoses were tested according to the European consensus methodology with up to 14 allergens prepared according to Chinese National Standards. The reactions were scored using the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group visual scoring system. Results: A total of 3472 PACD reactions in 2454 subjects (49.5%) were recorded. The most common agents were chlorpromazine (44.3%), followed by para-aminobenzoic acid (14.7%), thimerosal (8.9%), and sulfanilamide (6.9%). Allergic contact dermatitis reactions comprised 409 reactions in 399 subjects (8%). Photoinhibition and photoaugmentation of allergic contact dermatitis compromised 3810 reactions in 2412 subjects and 11 reactions in 11 subjects, respectively. Irritant reactions (1928 reactions) were seen in 1140 subjects. Conclusions: The most predominant photoallergens in our region were chlorpromazine, para-aminobenzoic acid, thimerosal, and sulfanilamide, which likely reflected the particular exposures of this Chinese population. \u00a9 2014 American Contact Dermatitis Society.

A brief description of the instrumentation, operating procedures and data processing procedures is given. The data analyzed consists of estimates of the total strengths (cumulated amplitudes) of the electric signals during 24-hour periods. The thresholds are set low enough so that on most days a zero observation is returned. Non-zero observations are related to electric and magnetic storms, occasional man-made electrical effects, and, apparently, some pre-, co-, or postseismic signals. The main purpose of the analysis is to investigate the extent that the electric signals can be considered as preseismic in character. For this purpose the electric signals from each of five stations are jointly analyzed with the catalogue of local earthquakes within circular regions around the selected stations. A version of Ogata's Lin-Lin algorithm is used to estimate and test the existence of a pre-seismic signal. This model allows the effect of the electric signals to be tested, even after allowing for the effects of earthquake clustering. It is found that, although the largest single effect influencing earthquake occurrence is the clustering tendency, there remains a significant preseismic component from the electrical signals. Additional tests show that the apparent effect is not postseismic in character, and persists even under variations of the model and the time periods used in the analysis. Samples of the data are presented and the full data sets have been made available on local websites. \u00a9 Birkh\u00e1user Verlag, Basel, 2005.", "keywords": ["Beijing", "Earthquake risk", "Hawkes' self-exciting and mutually exciting model", "Ultra-low frequency electric signal"], "venue": "Pure and Applied Geophysics", "year": 2005, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309aaec0"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Su Wang", "org": "Department of Infection Diseases of Medical College"}, {"name": "Qun Chen", "org": "Department of Morphology of Medical College"}, {"name": "Xing Wang", "org": "Department of Infection Diseases of Medical College"}, {"name": "Yan Zhang", "org": "Department of Infection Diseases of Medical College"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Blood Disease of Medical College"}, {"name": "Zhong-Qiang Wang", "org": "Department of Blood Disease of Medical College"}], "title": "Effect of hepatitis B vaccine with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide or Bacilli Calmette Guerin on immune responses in mice", "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the effects of hepatitis B vaccine with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) or Bacilli Calmette Guerin on the immune responses in mice.

It resulted in complexity, difficulty and high risk of oil-gas exploration in the marine facies Paleozoic-Triassic and continental facies Mesozoic strata in the Lower Yangtze area, in addition, it brought up a situation that the secondly hydrocarbon generation and late pool formation could occur in the marine facies source beds.", "keywords": ["Orogeny and coupled/decoupled basin developing", "Reformed residual basin", "The Lower Yangtze Block", "The Yanshanian Orogeny and orogen"], "venue": "Scientia Geologica Sinica", "year": 2006, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309cf84b"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Gen-Yao Wu", "org": "Institute of Geology and Geophysics"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Jiangsu Oilfield"}, {"name": "Xing Liang", "org": "Zhejiang Oilfield Company"}, {"name": "Jun-Liang Chen", "org": "Exploration and Development Research Institute of Daqing Oilfield Company Ltd."}], "title": "The nature of the pre-Cretaceous \"Tanlu fault zone\" viewed in the light of basin-range coupling evolution on its both sides", "abstract": "The Tanlu fault zone is regarded as an intracontinental sinistral strike-slip fault. The predecessor of the fault zone was three important pre-Cretaceous boundary faults, the Paleo-Tanlu fault, Liao- Bo fault and Dunhua-Mishan fault; therefore the ranges and basins on its both sides belonged to different orogenic and basin-making dynamic systems. To the west of the fault zone, the Qinling- Dabie orogen between the Yangtze and the North China craton was an Indosinian collisional one, and the Hinggan-Mongolia (for short, Hing-Meng) orogen was a Hercynian Turkic-type (accretional arc-type) one. Both became intracontinental orogens during the Yanshanian movement. To the east of the fault zone, the Sulu orogen was a Yanshanides formed by collision between the Su-Wan block and Jiao-Liao craton; the Yanji-Chongjin orogen was an Indosinides formed by collision between the Jiao-Liao craton and Khanka block; and farther northwards, there occurred an oblique convergence-shear orogen (interplate orogen) resulting from amalgamation of a group of allochthonous terranes on the Siberian subcontinent along the Dunhua-Mishan fault. Based on what are mentioned above, three generations (Late Paleozoic-Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous) of basins have been distinguished and the evolution of the orogeny-coupled molasse basins and volcanic basins on both sides of the Tanlu fault zone have been analyzed. The comparative study confirms that the basins on both sides of the pre-Cretaceous Tanlu fault zone have their respective unique evolutional histories, rather than belonged to the same basin displaced sinistrally by the Tanlu fault zone. The study of the Paleozoic-Triassic epicontinental sediments on both sides of the fault further demonstrates that the Yangtze and North China cratons and Burean-Jiamusi block to the west of the fault zone had once been independent of the Su-Wan block, Jiao-Liao craton and Khanka block to the east. With the closure of part of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic basins in the Early Cretaceous, the embryonic form of the Asian continent appeared. The above-mentioned three boundary faults linked up each other and became an intracontinental sinistral strike-slip fault (the Tanlu fault zone), and then the regional tectonic evolution on both sides of the fault zone tended to be uniform.", "keywords": ["Both sides of the Tanlu fault zone", "Epicontinental sediments", "Molasse basin", "Orogeny", "Pre-Cretaceous", "Tectonic boundary", "Volcanic basin"], "venue": "Geological Bulletin of China", "year": 2008, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309e6a69"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Gen-Yao Wu", "org": "Institute of Geology and Geophysics"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Jiangsu Oilfield"}, {"name": "Xing Liang", "org": "Zhejiang Oilfield Company"}, {"name": "Jiang-Ping Liang", "org": "Exploration and Developing Research Institute of Daqing Oilfield Company Ltd."}, {"name": "De-Feng Zhu", "org": "Exploration and Developing Research Institute of Daqing Oilfield Company Ltd."}, {"name": "Jian-Guo Yang", "org": "Exploration and Developing Research Institute of Daqing Oilfield Company Ltd."}], "title": "Time-spatial developing laws of co-existed inherited and neogenic structures: with reference to significance of neogenic structures for oil-gas exploration", "abstract": "Co-existed inherited and neogenic structures might have some complicated spatial-time developing features.

The poor osseoperception of dental implants is due to the absence of periodontal ligaments and Ruffini-like endings as well as the secondary injury during the implant surgery and then the insufficient regeneration of damaged peripheral nerve fibers around the implants. It is a hot topic to improve the quantity and density of peripheral nerve fibers or mechanoreceptors around endosseous dental implants. Calcitonin gene-related peptide-alpha (\u03b1CGRP), a neuropeptide widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, is found to be upregulated in regenerating axons within injury zones and be capable of promoting local Schwann cells proliferation, which is critical for partnering during peripheral nerve regeneration.

Then the influence of FDC-SP transfection on hPDLC proliferation, osteogenic and fibrogenic phenotype expression was evaluated at the mRNA and protein level. Procollagen type I c-peptide production was measured and alizarin red staining was then conducted to demonstrate effect of FDC-SP on functional differentiation. We found that hPDLCs could be successfully transfected with FDC-SP. Cell proliferation and cell cycle tests indicated that transfection with FDC-SP did not affect hPDLC proliferation. Moreover, according to real-time PCR and Western blot results, expression levels of type 1 collagen alpha 1, type 1 collagen alpha 2 and type 3 collagen were upregulated while that of osteocalcin, osteopontin, and bone sialoprotein were downregulated in FDC-SP transfected cells. In addition, hPDLCs overexpressing FDC-SP exhibited higher PIP production than the controls.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate and amount of bone regeneration in defects filled with three different BCPs in relation to deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM). Method: Ten New Zealand rabbits were used in the experiment. Four defects of 6\u00a0mm in diameter were prepared in each rabbit, and they were filled with different biomaterials: BCP with HA/\u03b2-TCP ratio of 60/40 (BCPG1), ratio of 10/90 (BCPG2), a BCP with polylactide incorporated (moldable BCP) and DBBM. Group A (n\u00a0=\u00a05) rabbits were sacrificed after 3\u00a0months, and group B (n\u00a0=\u00a05) were sacrificed 6\u00a0months after surgery. Histological and histomorphometric analyses were performed. Mean percentages of mineralized new bone (%MNB), bone marrow (%BM), residual grafting material (%RG) and soft tissue (%ST) were calculated for each bone substitute. Results: Percentages of MNB in defects filled with the four bone substitutes were comparable after 3\u00a0months and 6\u00a0months. Amount of MNB regenerated for moldable BCP and DBBM after 6\u00a0months were significantly higher than after 3\u00a0months (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whereas those for BCPG1 and BCPG2 did not show significant change. Percentage RG was significantly higher in moldable BCP compared with BCPG1 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) after 3\u00a0months. Conclusion: After 3\u00a0months, the granules-form synthetic materials performed better than DBBM in terms of bone regeneration. The grafting materials performed similarly after 6\u00a0months of healing.

The adhesion of irradiated osteoblast-like cells, in terms of number, area, and fluorescence intensity on the titanium surface, was evaluated using immunofluorescence staining. Results. Numerous nanosize pits were seen only in the F-TiO surface. The pits were more remarkable and uniform on F-TiO surface than on TiO surface; however, the amplitude of peaks and bottoms on F-TiO surface appeared to be smaller than on TiO surface. The Sa value and Sdr percentage of TiO surfaces were significantly higher than those of F-TiO surface. The concentrations of main elements such as titanium, oxygen, and carbon were similar on both surfaces. The number of irradiated osteoblasts adhered on the control surface was larger than on fluoride-modified surface. Meanwhile, the cells on the fluoride-modified surface formed more actin filaments.

Objective: To study the relationship of increased pulse pressure with the occurrence and severity degree of cerebral infarction by analyzing the data of pulse pressure recorded in hospitalized patients with acute cerebral infarction. Design: Case-control analysis. Setting: First Af filiated Hospital of Harbin Medical University. Participants: A total of 300 patients hospitalized at the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University between June 2002 and January 2003 for ischemic cerebral infarction were enrolled, including 196 males and 104 females aged (57.9\u00b111.9) years. Another 199 persons who came to the same hospital for physical examination at the same period were set as normal group, including 110 males and 89 females aged (55.9\u00b112.4) years. Methods: 1 Measurement of blood pressure: Systolic pressure and diastolic pressure of each person were recorded with mercury sphygmomanometer at the site of brachial artery of the right upper extremity and pulse pressure was calculated. 2 Evaluation of neurological impairment: Upon hospital admission, each patient with ischemic cerebral infarction was evaluated with the stroke scale made by the National Institute of Health (NIHSS), in which a higher scale means more severe infarction.

Methods: A total of 68 renal calculi patients (31 males and 37 females) were recruited. The lateral recumbent percutaneous nephrolithotripsy was operated with Ho laser under ultrasonic guidance. 0.9% NaCT was used as perfusion fluid. The following items were recorded; mean arterial blood pressure(MAP), heart rate, central venous pressure (CVP), hemoglobin, sodium, potassium and chloride; perfusion time during operation; perioperative and post-operative complications. Results: (1) Peri-operative and post-operative conditions; the average operative time was 83.1 \u00b1 22.21 minutes. Two cases stopped because of bleeding after puncture and the tube of stoma was placed for stone clearance of the second time. There was more bleeding in 11 patients, but the operations were continued with blood transfusion and close monitoring. Two operations ceased because of a premonition of congestive heart failure. Nine patients needed post-operative blood transfusion and 18 had a post-operative fever. One patient bled in and around the tube and had a peri-renal infection a week later. (2) Changes of observation parameters; there was no significant difference in CVP, heart rate, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium and chloride (P > 0.05). The post-perfusion value of MAP increased(P < 0.05) especially in the cases of more bleeding and long time of irrigation. Peri-operative and post-operative injection of furosemide could reduce the CVP value. The average irrigation time in the fever group was longer than the non-fever group (P < 0.05) and the CVP value of the fever group was higher than the non-fever group(P < 0.05). Conclusion: Low pressure and short time of perfusion are safe in clinical practice. Congestive heart failure after the perfusion and the occurrence of post-operative infections are difficult to avoid when there are a long time of irrigation and more bleeding during operation.

Up to now, little is known, however, if methylseleninic acid (MSA) has the anticancer effect on lung cancer or not. The objective of this study is to detect the effect of MSA on proliferation inhibition and apoptotic induction for human high-metastatic large cell lung cancer cell line L9981, and to explore the molecular mechanisms. Methods: The changes of proliferation, clone formation, apoptotic level and cell cycles were detected in L9981 by trypan blue staining, clone formation suppression test, and flow cytometry before and after treating with different concentration of MSA. The expression level of proliferative-related and apoptotic-related genes was also determined in L9981 by flow cytometry. Results: (1) The proliferation ability of L9981 was remarkably inhibited at the concentration of 0.5 \u03bcmol/L of MSA (P<0. 05), and the cells were arrested at G0/G1 phase after treating with the same concentration. (2) Apoptosis of L9981 was remarkably induced by MSA at the concentration of 2.5 \u03bcmol/L (P<0. 05). (3) The clone formation ability of L9981 was significantly suppressed by MSA at the concentration of 5.0 \u03bcmol/L (P<0.05). (4) The expression levels of P53, P21, Fas, FasL and Bax were remarkably up-regulated after treatment with MSA. Conclusion: (1) MSA can significantly suppress the proliferation and clone formation ability of human high-metastatic large cell lung cancer cell line L9981, and also induce apoptosis of L9981.

Accordingly, this research commenced from three main aspects, selected the evaluation indices, and then established the Evaluation Index System of Beijing Forest Ecosystem Health (EIS-BFEH). In the EIS-BFEH, each of the three foundations contained an easily-operated and standard sub-index system, which compounded the specific natural and social conditions of Beijing and was concrete enough to measure and evaluate.

We show that a model of a surface anelastic layer of 10km thickness over an elastic lower crust cannot explain the observed amplitude of deformation. A relaxation model featuring 30km of elastic upper crust over 40km of a ductile lower crust will account for the main features of exponential attenuation of post-seismic deformation. Combination of the two models, however, provides an even better fit including the fact that the deformation rate was higher in the first few weeks and slower thereafter. The viscous layer in the lower crust provides good control of the post-seismic deformation, including the long term decay of deformation over a period of months. The upper anelastic layer may contribute to the observed high deformation rate in the initial few weeks after the main earthquake.

In this paper, we investigate the laboratory AMR phenomenon of acoustic emission (AE), and attempt to understand the physical mechanism of AMR behavior from the point of view of rock deformation. AE data used in this paper are from a granitic porphyry (GP) sample with heterogeneous structure, including grains of different size and a naturally healed joint. Based on a stochastic AMR model, the microfracturing activity during rock deformation is analyzed. Three stages, Pre-AMR, AMR and nucleation, that cover the entire deformation period, are defined according to their different microfracturing features. The fractal structure of each stage is investigated. Our results indicate that the AE activity is highly sensitive to both the stress load and the rock structure. The AMR stage, in which the moderate AE events demonstrated typical AMR behaviors, features a process of stress concentration and stress transfer on the fault plane. The AMR stage had a constant stress load condition and was characterized by a much earlier increase of AE rate than the elevation of mean AE magnitude, both of which are consistent with the results derived from the damage rheology model (Bens-Zion and Lyakhovsky, 2002). The AMR stage was immediately followed by the nucleation stage, caused by quasi-static/dynamic fracture of the main fault. Therefore, regarding the GP sample, the AMR stage is a long-term preparatory process for dynamic fault fracture. \u00a9 Birkh\u00e4user Verlag, Basel 2008.", "keywords": ["Accelerating activity", "Acoustic emission (AE)", "AIC", "AMR model", "Fractal structure", "Rock deformation"], "venue": "Pure and Applied Geophysics", "year": 2008, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309b7374"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Yun-Sheng Shao", "org": ""}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": ""}, {"name": "Lan-Jiao Yang", "org": ""}, {"name": "Hai-Xing Xu", "org": ""}, {"name": "Yi-Hua Yin", "org": ""}], "title": "Vitro biodegradability and drug release of hydrogels for colonic-site drug delivery", "abstract": "Biodegradable hydrogels based on butyl acrylate, acrylic acid cross-linked with 4, 4'-di(methacryloylmino) azoben-zene were prepared.

Objective: To study the effect of Xiangdan injection and growth factors on directional differentiation of UCB-MSCs into neural cells, and to compare with the effect of simple growth factor induction. Design, Time and Setting: The immunocytochemistry study was conducted at the Department of Histology and Embryology, Weifan Medical College between September 2006 and April 2008. Materials: The umbilical cord blood was collected at Weifang Woman and Infants Nursing Center. The effective integrant of Xiangdan injection was tanshinol. Methods: The umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. Human UCB-MSCs was purified by the adherence screening, and amplified in vitro, the cell surface marker was detected by immunofluorescence method. 30 g/L Xiangdan injection with epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor was used to induce differentiation of MSCs into neural cells in the Xiangdan injection + growth factor group, and the results were compared with growth factor induction group. Main Outcome Measures: The expression of neuron-specific marker (NeuN, \u03b2 -TubulinIII) and glial fibrillary acidic protein was measured using immunocytochemical and immunofluorescence methods before and after induction. Results: Xiangdan injection combined with growth factors had small injuries to UCB-MSCs, with high induction efficiency. UCB-MSCs displayed neuronal morphologies and there were long processes out from the cell body when the MSCS were induced by Xiangdan injection. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence methods showed that induced cells derived from MSCs expressed NeuN and \u03b2 -TubulinIII, but few expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein. The positive cell rates of NeuN and \u03b2 - TubulinIII were significantly higher in the Xiangdan injection + growth factor group than in the growth factor induction group (P < 0.05). Positive cell rate of glial fibrillary acidic protein was significantly lower compared with the growth factor induction group (P < 0.05).

Methods: CA4-loaded liposomes were prepared by thin-film dispersion method. The linear arginine-glycine-aspartic acid tripeptide (RGD) with affinity for integrins such as v3 expressed on rapidly proliferative vascular endothelial cells was coupled to the distal end of polyethylene glycol (PEG) connected on the surface of SSL. The liposome delivery system was characterized in terms of size and size distribution profiles by dynamic light scattering method, entrapment efficiency, and leakage properties by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The uptake efficiency by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was evaluated by confocal microscopy. The therapeutic efficacy was quantitatively assessed by choroidal flat mounts. Results: CA4-loaded RGD-SSL (RGD-SSL-CA4) was obtained with an entrapment efficiency over 70% and an average diameter of \u223c120 nm. The leakage property of RGD-SSL-CA4 was similar with SSL-CA4, both were slower than CA4 ethanol solution. Confocal microscopy studies revealed that RGD-SSL could facilitate the liposomes' uptake into HUVECs.

Materials and methods: Three hundred and sixty-two consecutive NSCLC patients who underwent F-18 FDG PET/CT scanning were retrospectively analyzed. Each image of PET/CT, combined CT, and PET was performed at 10 separate areas and interpreted blindly and separately. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of F-18 FDG PET/CT, combined CT and F-18 FDG PET were calculated and the results were statistically analyzed. Results: Bone metastasis was confirmed in 82 patients with 331 positive segments based on the image findings and clinical follow-up. On patient-based analysis, the sensitivity of F-18 FDG PET/CT (93.9%) was significantly higher than those of combined CT (74.4%) and F-18 FDG PET (84.1%), respectively (p < 0.05). The overall specificity and accuracy of combined CT, F-18 FDG PET, and F-18 FDG PET/CT were 90.7%, 93.2%, 98.9% and 87.0%, 91.2%, and 97.8%, respectively (compared with PET/CT, p < 0.05). On segment-based analysis, the sensitivity of the three modalities were 79.5%, 94.3%, and 98.8%, respectively (compared with PET/CT, p < 0.05). The overall specificity and accuracy of the three modalities were 87.9%, 89.2%, 98.6% and 84.5%, 91.2%, 98.7%, respectively (compared with PET/CT, p < 0.05). Conclusion: F-18 FDG PET/CT is superior to F-18 FDG PET or combined CT in detecting bone metastasis of NSCLC patients because of the complementation of CT and PET. It is worth noting that the added value of F-18 FDG PET/CT may beneficially impact the clinical management of NSCLC. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, a few studies have reported that KSR1 can activate c-Raf-1. Therefore, whether KSR1 possesses a kinase activity has been an unresolved issue until now. Materials and Methods: pCMV-Tag2b-KSR plasmids were transfected into 293T cells. In vitro autophosphorylation was assayed by autoradiography and in vitro kinase was assayed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Results: We observed that wild-type KSR1 (WT-KSR) and N-terminal KSR1 (N-KSR) were phosphorylated, but the C-terminal KSR1 (C-KSR) and vector proteins were not. The high performance liquid chromatography profile showed not only the adenosine diphosphate peak but also the uridine triphosphate peak in the WT-KSR and N-KSR groups; both peaks were considerably more significant in these groups than in the others. The WT-KSR and N-KSR groups exhibited transphosphorylation and autophosphorylation activities, while the other groups revealed almost no activity. Discussion: Here, we demonstrate the nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity of the KSR1 complex and that this activity can be independent of the C-terminus of KSR1. Additionally, we found the autophosphorylation activity of the KSR1 complex to be extremely weak, suggesting that the KSR1 complex possesses an extremely weak kinase activity irrespective of whether it is nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity or serine/threonine protein kinase activity. These data suggest that the kinase activity of the KSR1 complex is derived from its associated proteins. \u00a9 Tianjin Lung Cancer Institute and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty.

In recent decades, the study of vulnerability has gained a position of centrality in natural hazards research. How to quantitatively assess vulnerability has raised much interest in academia. Researchers have proposed a variety of methods for quantitative assessment. But these methods are very sensitive to weights set for subindices. As a result, analytic results are often less convincing. A model based on data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used for the assessment of regional vulnerability to natural hazards in an attempt to improve existing analytical methods. Using a regional natural disaster system framework, this article constructs an input-output DEA model for the assessment of regional vulnerability, and takes China\u2019s mainland as a case study area. The result shows that the overall level of vulnerability to natural hazards in mainland China is high. The geographical pattern is that vulnerability is highest in western China, followed by diminishing vulnerability in central China, and lowest vulnerability levels in eastern China.

Methods: A total of 137 healthy adult volunteers were enrolled from June 2010 to August 2010.The technique was standardized with citrated blood and kaolin activator. And a Haemoscope 5000 device was employed. The TEG parameters analyzed were R, K, \u03b1, maximal amplitude (MA), LY30 and coagulation index (CI). All volunteers underwent the tests of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT) and plasma fibrinogen level with the same blood sample. Results: The reference ranges of 95% for 137 volunteers were R: 3.8-8.4 min, K: 0.8-3.3 min, \u03b1-Angle: 46.2-76.2\u00b0, MA: 50.0-70.8 mm, LY30: -3.3%-4.0% and CI: -3.8-2.9. Overall, 24.1% (33/137) of the volunteers had at least one abnormal parameter while 7.3% (10/137) would have been considered coagulopathy had the manufacturer's reference values been used, resulting in a test specificity of 76.0%. As compared with the western ethnicity (the manufacturer's reference values), Chinese healthy volunteers were associated with lower fibrinogen functions. There were significantly different in R, K, \u03b1-Angle, MA and CT between men and women groups (all P < 0.01).

Ganoderma sp.En3 had a strong ability of decolorizing four synthetic dyes, two simulated dye bath effluents and the real textile dye effluent. Induction in the activity of laccase during the decolorization process indicated that laccase played an important role in the efficient decolorization of different dyes by this fungus. Phytotoxicity study with respect to Triticum aestivum and Oryza sativa demonstrated that Ganoderma sp.En3 was able to detoxify four synthetic dyes, two simulated dye effluents and the real textile dye effluent. The laccase gene lac-En3-1 and its corresponding full-length cDNA were then cloned and characterized from Ganoderma sp.En3. The deduced protein sequence of LAC-En3-1 contained four copper-binding conserved domains of typical laccase protein. The functionality of lac-En3-1 gene encoding active laccase was verified by expressing this gene in the yeast Pichia pastoris successfully.

The influence of KRAS mutation status on the outcomes was also investigated. Methods: Literature retrieval, trials selection and assessment, data collection, and statistical analysis were performed according to the Cochrane Handbook 5.0.2. The outcome measures were tumor response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, and adverse effects. Results: Four randomized controlled trials, comprising totally 2,912 patients, were included. Meta-analysis showed higher response rate (RR 1.93; 95% CI, 1.14-3.26) and significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS; HR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67-0.95) in cetuximab-chemotherapy groups versus chemotherapy groups. There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups regarding overall survival (OS; HR 0.95; 95% CI, 0.87-1.05).

The study indicates that the all-fiber self-mixing speckle system can be applied in remote velocity sensing and measurement. \u00a9 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.", "keywords": ["Energy density", "Erbium-doped fiber laser", "Real time velocity measurement", "Self-mixing speckle"], "venue": "Physics Procedia", "year": 2011, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309dc888"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Bixia Ke", "org": "Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}, {"name": "Lu Ran", "org": "Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}, {"name": "Shuyu Wu", "org": "U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, {"name": "Xiaoling Deng", "org": "Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}, {"name": "Changwen Ke", "org": "Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}, {"name": "Zijian Feng", "org": "Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention"}, {"name": "Jay K.

Understanding practice patterns can help health officials assess the sensitivity of laboratory-based enteric infection surveillance systems and the need to improve antibiotic prescribing practices. We surveyed physicians in Guangdong province, China, to measure their practices for patients with acute diarrhea. A standardized questionnaire was used to interview physicians working in hospitals participating in a Salmonella surveillance system in Guangdong, China. The questionnaire asked physicians about their routine practice for patients with diarrhea, including how they managed the last patient they had seen with acute diarrhea. We calculated the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for factors associated with ordering a stool culture and for prescribing antibiotics. We received surveys from 237 physicians across 22 hospitals in Guangdong. For the last patient with diarrhea whom they had evaluated, 134 (57%) reported ordering a stool culture. The most common reasons for not ordering a stool culture included that it takes too long to receive the result, that the patient is not willing to pay for the test, and that the patient's illness was too mild to warrant testing. Most physicians prescribed at least one medication for the last patient with diarrhea whom they had evaluated. Of the 237 physicians surveyed, 153 (65%) prescribed antibiotics, 135 (57%) probiotics, and 115 (49%), a gastric mucosal protective drug. In conclusion, physicians in Guangdong, China, reported high rates of ordering bacterial stool cultures from patients with diarrhea, possibly associated with their hospital's participation in a special surveillance project. The high rate of antibiotic prescribing suggests that efforts to promote judicious antibiotic use, such as physician education, are needed. \u00a9 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Foodborne Pathogens and Disease", "year": 2012, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309ecf98"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "School of Mathematics and Computer Sciences"}, {"name": "Shan Da Fan", "org": "Department of Mathematics"}, {"name": "Huo Xiong Wu", "org": "School of Mathematical Sciences"}], "title": "Lp bounds for singular integrals with rough kernels on product domains", "abstract": "This paper is concerned with singular integral operators on product domains with rough kernels both along radial direction and on spherical surface.

Recently, a strong association of HLA-B*58:01 with allopurinol-induced severe cADRs was identified. This study investigated the predisposition to different types of allopurinol-cADRs conferred by HLA-B*5801 in a Han population from mainland China. Patients & methods:HLA-B genotyping was performed on 38 Chinese patients with different types of allopurinol-cADRs from 2008 to 2011. Results: All the allopurinol-cADR patients carried HLA-B7z.ast;58:01, in contrast with only 11.11% (7/63) in the allopurinol-tolerant patients (odds ratio [OR] = 580.07; p < 0.0001) and 13.99% (80/572) in a Han Chinese population from the human MHC database (dbMHC; OR: 471.09; p < 0.0001) carried the genotype. Each type of allopurinol cADRs revealed a statistically significant association with HLA-B*58:01. In particular, the risk of allopurinol-induced maculopapular eruption was significantly higher in patients with HLA-B*58:01 (OR: 339.00; p < 0.0001). Conclusion: The strong association of both the mild and severe types of allopurinol cADRs with the HLA-B*58:01 allele were observed.

Using an immunohistochemical staining assay, we demonstrate that there is a significant correlation between expression of Migfilin and pathological tumor grade in 217 clinical glioma samples. High Migfilin expression is associated with poor prognosis for patients with glioma. Investigation of the molecular mechanism shows that Migfilin promotes migration and invasion in glioma cells. Moreover, Migfilin positively modulates the expression and activity of epidermal growth factor receptor, and Migfilin-mediated migration and invasion depend on epidermal growth factor receptor-induced PLC-\u03b3 and STAT3-signaling pathways.

Combining high-throughput RNA sequencing, functional characterization, mechanistic studies and clinical validation, we identify leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) as a breast cancer metastasis suppressor downstream of the microRNA miR-9 and upstream of Hippo signaling. Restoring LIFR expression in highly malignant tumor cells suppresses metastasis by triggering a Hippo kinase cascade that leads to phosphorylation, cytoplasmic retention and functional inactivation of the transcriptional coactivator YES-associated protein (YAP). Conversely, loss of LIFR in nonmetastatic breast cancer cells induces migration, invasion and metastatic colonization through activation of YAP. LIFR is downregulated in human breast carcinomas and inversely correlates with metastasis. Notably, in approximately 1,000 nonmetastatic breast tumors, LIFR expression status correlated with metastasis-free, recurrence-free and overall survival outcomes in the patients. These findings identify LIFR as a metastasis suppressor that functions through the Hippo-YAP pathway and has significant prognostic power. \u00a9 2012 Nature America, Inc.

However, it is unclear whether EMT itself or specific EMT regulators play causal roles in these properties. Here we identify an EMT-inducing transcription factor, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), as a regulator of radiosensitivity and DNA damage response. Radioresistant subpopulations of breast cancer cells derived from ionizing radiation exhibit hyperactivation of the kinase ATM and upregulation of ZEB1, and the latter promotes tumour cell radioresistance in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ATM phosphorylates and stabilizes ZEB1 in response to DNA damage, ZEB1 in turn directly interacts with USP7 and enhances its ability to deubiquitylate and stabilize CHK1, thereby promoting homologous recombination-dependent DNA repair and resistance to radiation. These findings identify ZEB1 as an ATM substrate linking ATM to CHK1 and the mechanism underlying the association between EMT and radioresistance. \u00a9 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, the precise immunological mechanisms by which MFS confers protection have not been defined. Study aim: To explore the effects of MFS on innate immune system responses using a cold stress-induced immune impairment model as a means of examining MFS-mediated influenza prevention. We investigated the effects of MFS on toll-like receptor 2 and 4 (TLR2/4) gene and protein expression levels and on the percentage of NKp46 cells present in serum. No overt toxicity was observed following continuous administration of MFS at high doses. Methods: Kunming male mice (n=40) were randomly divided into 4 groups consisting of the continuous inhalation Sachet group, Yu-Ping-Feng powder (YPF-P) gavage positive control group, discontinuous inhalation MFS group and untreated controls. After 4 weeks, mice were sacrificed and lungs harvested. The expression of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2/4) gene and protein levels was assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analyses, respectively. An additional 60 Kunming mice were randomly divided into 6 groups comprised of a blank control group, continuous MFS inhalation group, an immune-compromised continuous MFS inhalation group, an immuno-compromised group, an immune-compromised MFS discontinuous inhalation group and an immune-compromised positive control group. Immune suppression was induced by cold stress (4\u00b0C/4 h daily for 3 days) and mice were treated with MFS or YPF-P before cold stress treatments. Immuno-compromised mice were treated with MFS continuously or intermittently, or treated with YPF-P. Blood samples were collected and examined for natural killer cells based on positive NKp46 staining. The isorhamnetin associated with MFS-induced immune modulation was obtained from 'wo ga le' which is considered to be a major component of MFS, and analyzed by HPLC. Results: Mice continuously inhaling MFS showed a moderate increase in TLR2/4 mRNA and protein levels compared to mice in the control and discontinuous inhalation groups. MFS significantly increased the TLR2/4 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, there was also a slightly significant increase in the number of NKp46 cells in the continuous inhalation group compared to controls and discontinuous inhalation group. Pretreatment with MFS partially prevented cold stress-induced inhibition of NKp46 cells. HPLC analysis of the 'wo ga le' associated with immune function identified the major component to be isorhamnetin. Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggested that MFS significantly enhanced TLR2/4 expression levels and the number of NKp46 cells in mice and moderately affected innate immune responses associated with protection against influenza, suggesting that isorhamnetin in the MFS enhanced innate immune potency. The use of MFS for the prevention of various respiratory tract infections can be attributed to its antimicrobial properties. In a pilot study, a large quantity (40 g) was administered over a prolonged period did not produce apparent toxicity. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.", "keywords": ["Cold stress", "Ethnopharmacy", "HPLC", "Influenza", "Isorhamnetin", "Miaoyao Fanggan Sachet", "NKP46", "TLR2", "TLR4", "Toxicity", "Yu-Ping-Feng powder"], "venue": "Journal of Ethnopharmacology", "year": 2012, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309d1d21"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Liujing Fan", "org": "Department of Physics"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Basic Physics Experiment Centerq"}, {"name": "Daofu Han", "org": "Basic Physics Experiment Centerq"}, {"name": "Shui He", "org": "Department of Physics"}], "title": "Fiber Bragg grating temperature sensor based on dynamic Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity", "abstract": "A method of demodulation wavelength with the dynamic extrinsic Fabry-P\u00e9rot (F-P) cavity is proposed.

The relationship between the pressure gradient, as well as the shear layer, and the development of turbulent kinetic energy in impinging shock-wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction flow at Mach 2.25 is analyzed based on the data of direct numerical simulation (DNS). It is found that the turbulent kinetic energy is amplified by strong shear in the separation zone and the adverse pressure gradient near the separation point. The pressure gradient was non-dimensionalised with local density, velocity, and viscosity. Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model is modified by introducing the non-dimensional pressure gradient into the production term of the eddy viscosity transportation equation. Simulation results show that the production and dissipation of eddy viscosity are strongly enhanced by the modification of S-A model. Compared with DNS and experimental data, the wall pressure and the wall skin friction coefficient as well as the velocity profile of the modified S-A model are obviously improved. Thus it can be concluded that the modification of S-A model with the pressure gradient can improve the predictive accuracy for simulating the shock-wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction. \u00a9 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of CSAA & BUAA.", "keywords": ["Eddy viscosity", "Pressure gradient", "Shock-wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction", "Spalart-Allmaras model", "Turbulent kinetic energy transport property"], "venue": "Chinese Journal of Aeronautics", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309d7cc6"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Economic and Management School"}, {"name": "Yang Liu", "org": "Economic and Management School"}, {"name": "Yong Niu", "org": "Economic and Management School"}], "title": "Credit ration by control of cognition difference", "abstract": "This paper introduces the cognition difference in the risk of investment projects between banks and enterprises into the model to analyze the relationship between risk cognition difference and the degree of credit rationing.

The influence of the suppressor and cupric ion concentrations on Bottom-Up filling were investigated. Pure Bottom-Up filling can be achieved with a strong enough suppressor and high copper concentration. The strength of suppressor determines the required amount of copper concentration.

In this study, we investigated the effect of MS-275, a selective class I HDAC inhibitor, on the development of renal fibrosis in a murine model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and activation of cultured renal interstitial fibroblasts. Methods/Findings: The UUO model was established by ligation of the left ureter and the contralateral kidney was used as a control. At seven days after UUO injury, kidney developed fibrosis as indicated by deposition of collagen fibrils and increased expression of collagen I, fibronectin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). Administration of MS-275 inhibited all these fibrotic responses and suppressed UUO-induced production of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta), increased expression of TGF-beta receptor I, and phosphorylation of Smad-3. MS-275 was also effective in suppressing phosphorylation and expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its downstream signaling molecule, signal transducer and activator of transcription-3. Moreover, class I HDAC inhibition reduced the number of renal tubular cells arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, a cellular event associated with TGF-beta1overproduction. In cultured renal interstitial fibroblasts, MS-275 treatment inhibited TGF-beta induced phosphorylation of Smad-3, differentiation of renal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts and proliferation of myofibroblasts. Conclusions and Significance: These results demonstrate that class I HDACs are critically involved in renal fibrogenesis and renal fibroblast activation through modulating TGF-beta and EGFR signaling and suggest that blockade of class I HDAC may be a useful treatment for renal fibrosis. \u00a9 2013 Liu et al.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309af696"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Jinhua Tang", "org": "Department of Medicine"}, {"name": "Na Liu", "org": "Department of Nephrology"}, {"name": "Evelyn Tolbert", "org": "Department of Medicine"}, {"name": "Murugavel Ponnusamy", "org": "Department of Medicine"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Medicine"}, {"name": "Rujun Gong", "org": "Department of Medicine"}, {"name": "George Bayliss", "org": "Department of Medicine"}, {"name": "Haidong Yan", "org": "Department of Nephrology"}, {"name": "Shougang Zhuang", "org": "Department of Medicine"}], "title": "Sustained activation of EGFR triggers renal fibrogenesis after acute kidney injury", "abstract": "Severe acute kidney injury (AKI) is frequently accompanied by maladaptive repair and renal fibrogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms that mediate these acute and chronic consequences of AKI remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined the role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in these processes using waved-2 (Wa-2) mice, which have reduced EGFR activity, and their wild-type (WT) littermates after renal ischemia. Renal EGFR phosphorylation was induced within 2 days after ischemia, increased over time, and remained elevated at 28 days in WT mice, but this was diminished in Wa-2 mice. At the early stage of postischemia (2 days), Wa-2 mice developed more severe acute renal tubular damage with less reparative responses as indicated by enhanced tubular cell apoptosis, and reduced dedifferentiation and proliferation as compared to WT animals. At the late stage of postischemia (28 days), Wa-2 mice exhibited a less severe renal interstitial fibrosis as shown by reduced activation/proliferation of renal myofibroblasts and decreased deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. EGFR activation also contributed to cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, a cellular event associated with production of profibrogenetic factors, in the injured kidney. Collectively, these results indicate that severe AKI results in sustained activation of EGFR, which is required for reparative response of renal tubular cells initially, but eventually leads to fibrogenesis. \u00a9 2013 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

These enhanced growth and invasion properties correlated with hCAP18/LL-37 induction. HCAP18/LL-37 expression was diminished by addition of two neutralizing antibodies, TLR2 or TLR6, as well as Cyp27B1 or VDR inhibitors. Furthermore, either the TLR2 or TLR6 antibody reduced vitamin D3 signaling and tumor cell progression in vitro. Addition of Cyp27B1 or VDR inhibitors abrogated TLR2/6 activation-induced expression of hCAP18/LL-37 in macrophages. Knockdown of tumor-produced versican V1 by RNAi in these tumor cells led to a decreased induction of hCAP18/LL-37 in macrophages. Versican V1 knockdown also inhibited TLR2 and vitamin D3 signaling, as well as growth and invasiveness of these tumor cells in the in vitro co-culture. In summary, we have found that versican V1 enhances hCAP18/LL-37 expression in macrophages through activation of TLR2 and subsequent vitamin D-dependent mechanisms which promote ovarian tumor progression in vitro. \u00a9 2013 Li et al.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309af759"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiong Wang", "org": "Department of Pharmacy"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Pharmacy"}, {"name": "Ze-Xiang Jin", "org": "Department of Pharmacy"}], "title": "Therapeutic effect of fructus hordei germinatus ethanol extract on hyperplasia of mammary gland in rats", "abstract": "Fructus Hordei Germinatus (Poaceae, Hordeum) has been traditionally used for treatment of female galactorrhea or Hyperplasia of Mammary Gland (HMG) in China. The overall purpose of this study was to evaluate the Anti-Hyperplasia of Mammary Gland (HMG) effect of Fructus Hordei G Ethanol extract (FHG-E) in HMG rats. Forty virgin female Wistar rats were randomly divided into blank control, HMG Model, Rupisanjie Capsule (RPSJC, positive control) and FHG-E groups, 10 in each. Injection of estrogen and progestogen were given to prepare rat models of HMG, RPSJC and FHG-E were given at the same time. Changes of nipple heights were measured sex hormone levels (E2, P, PRL, FSH and LH) in serum were estimated uterus and ovoiy index were calculated. Pathologic changes of mammary gland in rats were also observed by microscope. FHG-E could decrease the increased nipple height and uterus index, reduce the numbers of mammary gland lobules and secretion in HMG rats. It could also decrease E2, PRL and FSH levels in serum and increase the serum levels of P and LH significantly compared with the model group. The histopathological observation revealed that FHG-E obviously alleviated the degree of HMG. The contents of total flavonoid total alkaloid and total phenolic contents in the extract were also determined. The results showed that the 50% ethanolic extract from FHE contained total flavonoids 3.95\u00b10.06 mg Quercetin Equivalent (QE)/g extract total alkaloids 42.74\u00b10.08 mg Hordenine Equivalent (HE)/g extract and total phenolics 52.46\u00b10.12 mg Gallic Acid Equivalent (GAE)/g extract.

Two-dimensional hexagonal structure mesoporous silica film was found sensitive to traces of nitroaromatic trinitrotoluene. When enlarging the pore size, to improve the sensitivity, a lower sensitivity was actually obtained. This can be explained by the small molecule diameter of the explosive and the relatively large surface area of the mesoporous films. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area can be enlarged by a suitable 3D pore channel structure so that the fluorescence quenching sensitivity is improved for the nitro aromatic compounds vapors. Optimizing the pore size and channel structure can therefore well improve the sensing efficiency in this system. \u00a9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.", "keywords": ["Porosity", "Sol-gel", "Thin films", "Trace explosive detection"], "venue": "Journal of Sol-Gel Science and Technology", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309c2ef8"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhiwen Zhang", "org": "Center of Pharmaceutics"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "School of Pharmacy"}, {"name": "Shijun Jiang", "org": "School of Pharmacy"}, {"name": "Zeying Liu", "org": "School of Pharmacy"}, {"name": "Jian Huang", "org": "Center of Pharmaceutics"}, {"name": "Lingli Chen", "org": "Center of Pharmaceutics"}, {"name": "Haijun Yu", "org": "Center of Pharmaceutics"}, {"name": "Yaping Li", "org": "Center of Pharmaceutics"}], "title": "A self-assembled nanocarrier loading teniposide improves the oral delivery and drug concentration in tumor", "keywords": ["Nanocarrier", "Nanoparticles", "Oral delivery", "Self-assembly", "Teniposide"], "venue": "Journal of Controlled Release", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309ca829"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhiwen Zhang", "org": "Center of Pharmaceutics"}, {"name": "Zeying Liu", "org": "School of Pharmacy"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Center of Pharmaceutics"}, {"name": "Shijun Jiang", "org": "School of Pharmacy"}, {"name": "Yixin Wang", "org": "Center of Pharmaceutics"}, {"name": "Haijun Yu", "org": "Center of Pharmaceutics"}, {"name": "Qi Yin", "org": "Center of Pharmaceutics"}, {"name": "Jingbin Cui", "org": "School of Pharmacy"}, {"name": "Yaping Li", "org": "Center of Pharmaceutics"}], "title": "Reversal of multidrug resistance by mitochondrial targeted self-assembled nanocarrier based on stearylamine", "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) remains one of the major challenges for successful chemotherapy.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Male adult rats underwent 30 minutes of ischemia followed by 3, 24, or 72 h of reperfusion. Animals were pretreated with LA or vehicle before coronary artery ligation. The level of MI/R- induced LDH and CK release, infarct size, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac functional impairment were examined and compared. Western blot analysis was performed to elucidate the mechanism of LA pretreatment. The level of inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 released to serum and accumulated in injured myocardium as well as neutrophil accumulation in injured myocardium were also examined after MI/R injury. Our results reveal that LA administration significantly reduced LDH and CK release, attenuated myocardial infarct size, decreased cardiomyocytes apoptosis, and partially preserved heart function. Western blot analysis showed that LA pretreatment up-regulated Akt phosphorylation and Nrf2 nuclear translocation while producing no impact on p38MAPK activation or nitric oxide (NO) production. LA pretreatment also increased expression of HO-1, a major target of Nrf2. LA treatment inhibited neutrophil accumulation and release of TNF-\u03b1. Moreover, PI3K inhibition abolished the beneficial effects of LA. Conclusions/Significance: This study indicates that LA attenuates cardiac dysfunction by reducing cardiomyoctyes necrosis, apoptosis and inflammation after MI/R. LA exerts its action by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway as well as subsequent Nrf2 nuclear translocation and induction of cytoprotective genes such as HO-1. \u00a9 2013 Deng et al.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309ec5ff"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}, {"name": "Lu-Gang Huang", "org": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}, {"name": "Ping Lin", "org": "Department of Geriatrics, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital of Sichuan University"}], "title": "In vitro induction of adipose-derived stem cells into endothelial cells and angiogenic cells", "abstract": "Background: Adipose-derived stem cells, as the seed cells for tissue engineering, can be induced into endothelial cells, thereby solving the key problem of vascularization.

We observed that the transgene was heavily methylated in the liver (87.53%) from the founder generation, whereas its methylation rate was much lower in the kidney (70.47%). Spearman correlation analysis showed that there was a strong correlation on the methylation status between different generations in the same tissue, which was observed in both liver and kidney, and among all individuals in this pedigree.

With experimentations, the new algorithm is thereafter evaluated. Design/methodology/approach - Nearest-neighbor algorithm is the earliest proposed and the main collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, and its recommendation quality is seriously influenced by the sparsity of user ratings. By using rough set theory, the nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering algorithm can be improved in the sparsity data situation. The union of user rating items is used as the basis of similarity computing among users, and then a rating predicting method based on rough set theory is proposed to estimate missing values in the union of user rating items for decreasing sparsity. Findings - The sparsity problem of collaborative filtering can be alleviated by using the union of user rating items and estimating missing values based on rough set theory. The experimental results show that the new algorithm can efficiently improve recommendation quality of collaborative filtering.

The complete profiling of a pig is convenient to behavior analysis and to judge if it is sick. A pig's wandering causes the lack of its full profile being captured on video. For example, only part of the body or no body at all in the image when intelligently monitoring a single pig in a pigpen will result in an abnormal profile. Not all profiles, or camera angles, of the pig are efficient for behavior analysis in the case that the pig's profile is not fully revealed, such as the pig directly facing the camera. Only scenes with the fully exposed profile of the pig are convenient for observing and analyzing the symptoms of the pig. Therefore, it is essential to automatically segment the video that is monitoring the pigpen. A novel method is proposed for setting the frame attributes based on the level of exposure to a pig's profile in a standing posture. Two types of attributes are presented for each frame in the video recording, which represent the applicable and non-applicable profile of a pig. A pig's profile feature vector is calculated for differentiating the attributes after obtaining a profile of a single pig by image processing. The vector is composed of both the aspect ratio of the pig's external shape and a group of low frequency Fourier coefficients based on the pig's contour. The aspect ratio varies with the angle between the axis of the pig body and the horizontal line on the left side of the ground. The result of the test shows that the aspect ratio index is ideal and plays a significant role only in both the acute angle areas, i.e., [-30\u00b0, 30\u00b0] and [-150\u00b0, 150\u00b0]. Eight low frequency Fourier coefficients are also verified enough to describe the characteristic shape of the pig body in reconstructing the profile image of a single pig by the Fourier inversion method. Means and variances of both the feature vectors of the applicable and non-applicable profile contours are obtained from the sample training set. The category of the unknown frame is identified by the Mahalanobis distance discrimination from the testing video. The results showed that 91.7% of frames in the pig's profile could be properly recognized. Therefore, this method of producing the frame attributes based on a single pig's contour is reliable.

Deletions of azoospermia factor (AZF) fragments were confirmed with Y chromosome sequence-tagged sites (STSs) analysis using modified multiplex PCR. Results: The overall prevalence of AZF microdeletions was 16.95% (40/236). In the non-obstructive azoospermia group, 13 cases had AZFc deletion, 6 cases had AZFb + c deletion, 2 cases had AZFa deletion, 1 case had AZFb deletion.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the association of AZFc polymorphisms and male infertility in the Yi ethnic population, residents within Yunnan Province, China. Methods: A total of 224 infertile patients and 153 fertile subjects were selected in the Yi ethnic population. The study was performed by sequence-tagged site plus/minus (STS) analysis followed by gene dosage and gene copy definition analysis. Y haplotypes of 215 cases and 115 controls were defined by 12 binary markers using single nucleotide polymorphism on Y chromosome (Y-SNP) multiplex assays based on single base primer extension technology. Results: The distribution of Y haplotypes was not significantly different between the case and control groups. The frequencies of both gr/gr (7.6% vs. 8.5%) and b2/b3 (6.3% vs. 8.5%) deletions do not show significant differences. Similarly, single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis shows no significant difference of gene copy definition between the cases and controls. However, the frequency of partial duplications in the infertile group (4.0%) is significantly higher than that in the control group (0.7%). Further, we found a case with sY1206 deletion which had two CDY1 copies but removed half of DAZ genes. Conclusions: Our results show that male infertility is associated with partial AZFc duplications, but neither gr/gr nor b2/b3 deletions, suggesting that partial AZFc duplications rather than deletions are risk factors for male infertility in Chinese-Yi population. \u00a9 2013 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "keywords": ["AZFc polymorphism", "Azoospermia factor c (AZFc)", "b2/b3", "gr/gr", "Infertility"], "venue": "Journal of Zhejiang University: Science B", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309e1c4d"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhao-Yang Peng", "org": "Key Laboratory for the Structure and Evolution of Celestial Objects"}, {"name": "Xiao-Hong Zhao", "org": "National Astronomical Observatories/Yunnan Observatory"}, {"name": "Yue Yin", "org": "Key Laboratory for the Structure and Evolution of Celestial Objects"}, {"name": "Yu-Ying Bao", "org": "Department of Physics"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Department of Physics"}], "title": "The relationship between the power-law indices of the temporal properties on energy and the spectral lag and photon flux of gamma-ray burst pulses", "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that the dependence of the pulse temporal properties (pulse width, pulse rise width, pulse decay width, and pulse peak time) on energy is a power-law function.

The hardness increases first and then decreases with increasing temperature, and the elastic modulus decreases linearly as the swelling increases.

It is advantageous to the improvement of decision-making level and benefit of investment through performing comprehensive assessment on planning schemes. Comprehensive evaluation of distribution network planning is a multiple attribute decision making problem. The typical methods to solve this problem include analytic hierarchy process (AHP), data envelopment analysis (OEA), and technology for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPS IS), etc. It is of significance to select appropriate methods according to specific distribution network planning. For the first time, this paper proposes that evaluation methods could be selected according to three attributes of the evaluation object, including preference information, scheme number and the comparison between scheme number and index number. In the distribution network planning assessment, indices are not equally important. So it is a problem how to determine the preference information. The object' s scheme number could be either single or multiple, and the scheme number is normally less than the index number. Based on these characteristics, the suitable methods for distribution network planning are analytic hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) and the delphi method (OM). The overall process of distribution network planning assessment using the selected methods is also proposed, including construction of index system, setting of index weight, setting of index score standard, analysis of the evaluation results and so on. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by analysis on actual distribution network planning schemes for a certain region in 2015.

METHODS: The retinopathy of the 631 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was examined by ophthalmoscopy and fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), and the relative factors which possibly associate with the incidence and development of DR were collected. RESULTS: There were 205 patients with DR, the morbidity rate of DR was 32.5% (95%CI: 28.82%-36.15%), the nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) were 134 cases occupying 21.2% (95%CI: 18.04%-24.44%) and 71 cases occupying 11.3% (95%CI: 8.78%-13.72%) of the patients with DR, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that income, living environment, whether treatment by insulin, combined with diabetic nephropathy (DN), combined with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), hold on exercise, course of diabetes, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2 hours' postprandial plasma glucose (2hPG), glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure (SBP), total cholesterol (TC), urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER), serum creatinine (SCr), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were significant different among the patients without DR, the patients with NPDR and the patients with PDR (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Multivariate ordinal Logistic regression analysis showed that the incidence and development of DR increased in patients with longer course of diabetes, high HbA1c, high UAER and without exercise, and decreased in patients without DN and DPN (P<0.05 or P<0.01).

The 21 core germplasms that were negative for Lxx after natural infection and artificial inoculation can provide elite resistance source materials and reference frames for the effective breeding of RSD-resistant sugarcane varieties. Under natural conditions, 116 (84.67%) and 21 (15.33%) out of 137 germplasms were positive and negative for Lxx, respectively, as determined by PCR detection, which suggests that a relatively high ratio of sugarcane core germplasms was sensitive to RSD, while few were resistant to RSD. The sequencing and analysis of 30 randomly selected PCR products showed that all 30 sequences were identical or highly homologous to the corresponding Lxx genome region published in GenBank (99.54-100% similarity).

Although we have made great progress in mapping resistance genes, little is known about the mechanism of resistance. By de novo transcriptome assembling, we gained sufficient transcript data to analyze changes in gene expression of early interaction in response to SBPH and RSV infection in rice. Respectively 648 and 937 DEGs were detected from the disease-resistant (Liaonong 979) and the susceptible (Fengjin) varieties, most of which were up-regulated. We found 37 genes related to insect resistance, which mainly included genes for jasmonate-induced protein, TIFY protein, lipoxygenase, as well as trypsin inhibitor genes and transcription factor genes. In the interaction process between RSV and rice, 87 genes were thought to be related to RSV resistance; these primarily included 12 peroxidase biosynthesis genes, 12 LRR receptor-like protein kinase genes, 6 genes coding pathogenesis-related proteins, 4 glycine-rich cell wall structural protein genes, 2 xyloglucan hydrolase genes and a cellulose synthase. The results indicate that the rice-pathogen interaction happened both in disease-resistant and susceptible varieties, and some genes related to JA biosynthesis played key roles in the interaction between SBPHs and rice. When rice was infected by RSV a hypersensitive reaction (HR) in the disease-resistant variety was suppressed, which resulted from an increase in peroxidase expression and down-regulation of LRR receptor-like protein kinase and pathogenesis-related proteins, while, the changes of peroxidase biosynthesis, glycine-rich cell wall structural protein, cellulose synthase and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase could lead to the strengthening of physical barriers of rice, which may be an important resistance mechanism to RSV in rice. \u00a9 2013 Zheng et al.", "keywords": [""], "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2013, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309b0abf"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Haijing Sun", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Corrosion and Protection"}, {"name": "Li Liu", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Corrosion and Protection"}, {"name": "Ying Li", "org": "State Key Laboratory for Corrosion and Protection"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Key Laboratory for Marine Corrosion and Protection"}, {"name": "Yonggui Yan", "org": "Key Laboratory for Marine Corrosion and Protection"}], "title": "The performance of Al-Zn-In-Mg-Ti sacrificial anode in simulated deep water environment", "abstract": "The corrosion behaviour and working performance of Al-Zn-In-Mg-Ti sacrificial anode were studied in simulated deep water environment using potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, self-discharge, gravimetric and imaging measurements.

The clinical features were determ ined by complete ophthalmologic exam inations.

RESULTS: Five variants in the RP1 gene and one in the RHO gene were detected in 2 0 probands. Four missense changes (rs4447 7 2, rs446227, rs41 435 2, rs441 800) and one non-coding variant (rs5 63 4061 5) were common SNPs and none of them showed a significant relationship with RPSP.

Hypoxic cancer cells are extremely resistant to therapies since they elicit strong survival ability due to the cellular adaptive response to hypoxia, which is controlled by HIF-1 and HIF-2. The present study has demonstrated that sorafenib downregulated the expression of HIF-1\u03b1, making the hypoxic response switch from HIF-1\u03b1- to HIF-2\u03b1-dependent pathways, resulting in upregulation of HIF-2\u03b1, which contributes to the insensitivity of hypoxic HCC cells to sorafenib. HIF-2\u03b1 played a dominant role in regulating VEGF, thus sorafenib in turn increased the expression of VEGF (a downstream molecule of both HIF-1 and HIF-2) and cyclin D1 (a downstream molecule of HIF-2), but reduced the expression of LDHA (a downstream molecule of HIF-1), in hypoxic HCC cells. 2ME2 significantly reduced the expression of both HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1, and their downstream molecules, VEGF, LDHA and cyclin D1, rendering hypoxic HCC cells to increased sensitivity to 2ME2. 2ME2 also inhibited the nuclear translocation of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 proteins, but had no effect on their mRNA expression. 2M2 synergized with sorafenib to suppress the proliferation and induction of apoptosis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo, and inhibited tumoral angiogenesis.

However, there are few studies on how microRNAs are dysregulated. miR-139-5p, an important tumor suppressor, is often underexpressed in gastrointestinal cancer cells. Here, we describe post-transcriptional regulation of this intronic microRNA in human colorectal cancer. miR-139-5p is expressed independently of its overexpressed host gene PDE2A in colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines. The miR-139-5p target genes IGF1R, ROCK2 and RAP1B exert regulatory effects on the miR-139-5p expression level, relying on their ability to compete for miR-139-5p binding. These overexpressed target genes also regulate each others' protein levels through 3\u2032-UTRs, thus regulating tumor cell growth and motility properties. Our study provides a mechanistic, experimentally validated rationale for intronic microRNA dysregulation in colorectal cancer, revealing novel oncogenic roles of IGF1R, ROCK2 and RAP1B 3\u2032-UTRs. Here, we describe a post-transcriptional mutual regulation between tumor suppressor miR-139-5p and its target genes IGF1R, ROCK2 and RAP1B.

Under the optimum conditions, a lubricating base stock was synthesized, and its physical, chemical and electrical properties were determined. Findings - The experimental results showed that after a 5 h reaction time at 353 K, the olefins conversion of 94.9 per cent and the yield of product of 69.3 per cent were obtained with a molar ratio of biphenyl to 1-octene of 1.2 and a molar ratio of MSA to 1-octene of 1. Under the optimum conditions, a lubricating base stock was synthesized, and its physical, chemical and electrical properties were determined.

Methods: A total of 500 healthy adults were divided into two groups of 250 people per group (group A, 16-30 years old and group B, 31-60 years old; male-to-female ratio, 1:1). All volunteers were non-smokers; they were irrigated with saline, and multiple inflammatory cells in the perfusate were analyzed. Results: Irrigation was successfully performed in 479 cases, a success rate of 95.80%. The types of inflammatory cells showed a skewed distribution. The median number and interquartile range (IQR) of eosinophils were 0 and 0.2, respectively. These values were 0.4 and 2.2, respectively, for neutrophils and 0 and 0, respectively, for both lymphocytes and macrophages. There was no significant difference between males and females (P>0.05). There was a significant difference in the numbers of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the different age groups (P=0.000), but there was no significant difference in the numbers of eosinophils and macrophages (P>0.05).

Compared with conventional microporous ZSM- 5, the MMZ- 5 zeolite possessed more Lewis acid sites and many more accessible Br\u00f6nsted acid sites for bulky DTBPy molecule (1.05 nm in diameter). This mesoporous zeolite thus afforded both effective active sites and reaction voids allowing the reaction of larger molecules, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity and stability of the MMZ-5 zeolite during the benzylation of naphthalene with benzyl chloride (BC) to form bulky monobenzylnaphthalenes and dibenzylnaphthalenes, during which the selectivity for monobenzylnaphthalenes was estimated to be about 79%.

The mechanisms of benzene-induced toxicity and leukemogenicity are not fully understood, although the involvement of several pathways has been suggested, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, cell cycle regulation and programmed cell death. In the present study, we investigated the effect of hydroquinone (HQ), a major benzene metabolite, on the viability of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and explored the underlying mechanisms. Methods: First, we study the the effect of HQ on BMSCs cell viability, apoptosis and the expressions of MDR1 and NF-\u03baB. Then we investigate the MDR1 on cell viability and cell apoptosis for BMSCs under HQ treatment. Finally, we studied the impact of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) on the expression of MDR1. Results: Our results showed that HQ decreased cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis of BMSCs, as determined by the MTT assay and flow cytometry. Western blotting and quantitative PCR showed that HQ downregulated the expression of the MDR1 gene by inhibiting the activation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. Overexpression of MDR1 attenuated the inhibitory effect of HQ on cell viability in BMSC. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest the involvement of the multidrug resistance membrane transporter MDR1 and the NF-\u03baB pathway in the cytotoxicity of benzene and its metabolites.

On day 5 of culture, DCs were treated with RBcs for 24 h, and then purified using magnetic beads. The maturation of DCs was induced by TNF-\u03b1 or LPS.

RBcs neither inhibited DC maturation nor promoted DC apoptosis. Moreover, RBcs-exposed DCs stimulated allogenetic T cell proliferation and T cell-derived cytokine production.

Fifteen patients (15.3%) were categorized as having cytoplasmic and/or proteinase 3 (PR3) ANCA and 83 patients (84.7%) had perinuclear and/or myeloperoxidase (MPO) ANCA. After the induction phase treatment, the disease was resistant to therapy in 24 (25%) of the patients. A response to initial treatment occurred in 74 patients (75%). Of these 74 patients, remission was achieved and sustained with or without maintenance therapy in 41 patients (55%). Multivariable logistic regression models revealed that female sex was a statistically significant predictor of treatment resistance (OR 2.85; 95% CI: 1.06-2.86; p = 0.036). Additionally, elevated serum creatinine level, with each increment of 150 \u03bcmol/l, predicted resistance (p = 0.002). Among the 74 patients where remission was achieved, Cox proportional hazards models detected that those with PR3 ANCA were 1.31 times more likely to experience a relapse than were patients with MPO ANCA (95% CI: 1.01-5.35; p = 0.0001). Lung involvement was associated with an increased risk of relapse (HR 1.87; 95% CI: 1.12-4.35; p = 0.014). Although not significant, advanced age tended to be associated with relapse (p = 0.08). Conclusion. Our findings highlight the important effect of female sex and severity of renal disease at presentation as predictors of treatment resistance, and PR3 ANCA and lung involvement as predictors of relapse. \u00a9 2014.

Methods: We compared the clinical characteristics and auto-antibody profiles between SLE patients with fetal loss and SLE patients with normal pregnancies. The relationship between selected variables and fetal loss was examined by univariate analysis and binary logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 992 patients with 2026 pregnancies were recruited. Fifty women experienced fetal loss, including 49 spontaneous abortion, eight stillbirths and three neonatal deaths. The overall fetal loss rate was 3.0% (60/2026). Arthritis and serositis were observed significantly more frequently (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in normal pregnancy women. The rate of thrombocytopenia was significantly increased in patients with fetal loss (30.0% vs. 16.1%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.010), while there was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of nephropathy, central nervous system involvement between the normal pregnancy group and fetal loss group.

Viral tropism analyses have revealed two intriguing means of EBV infection, either by a receptor-mediated infection of B cells or by a cell-to-cell contact-mediated infection of non-susceptible ECs. Herein, we report a novel \"in-cell infection\" mechanism for EBV infection of non-susceptible ECs through the formation of cell-in-cell structures. Epithelial CNE-2 cells were invaded by EBV-infected Akata B cells to form cell-in-cell structures in vitro. Such unique cellular structures could be readily observed in the specimens of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Importantly, the formation of cell-in-cell structures led to the autonomous activation of EBV within Akata cells and subsequent viral transmission to CNE-2 cells, as evidenced by the expression of viral genes and the presence of virion particles in CNE-2 cells. Significantly, EBV generated from in-cell infected ECs displayed altered tropism with higher infection efficacy to both B cells and ECs. In addition to CNE-2 tumor cells, cell-in-cell structure formation could also mediate EBV infection of NPEC1-Bmi1 cells, an immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line. Furthermore, efficient infection by this mechanism involved the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Thus, our study identified \"in-cell infection\" as a novel mechanism for EBV infection. Given the diversity of virus-infected cells and the prevalence of cell-in-cell structures during chronic infection, we speculate that \"in-cell infection\" is likely a general mechanism for EBV and other viruses to infect non-susceptible ECs.", "keywords": ["Cell-in-cell structures", "Epstein-Barr virus", "In-cell infection", "PI3K/AKT pathway", "Tropism"], "venue": "Cell Research", "year": 2015, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309d3711"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Zhaohui Tang", "org": "China University of Geosciences"}, {"name": "Xinxin Dong", "org": "China University of Geosciences"}, {"name": "Yue Yang", "org": "Linyi Department of Land and Resources"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "China University of Geosciences"}], "title": "Research on the relationship between grain composition and repose angle of coal gangue in Dongkuang mine, Heshan city, Guangxi, China", "abstract": "Heshan, a city in Southwest China, has been built over an old coal mining area.

To facilitate designing management project of coal gangue, we made an investigation of the largest coal gangue heap in Dongkuang Mine of Heshan. Firstly, the grain composition of coal gangue was estimated through the sieving method, then the representative grading curve was drawn through the statistics method of coarse grain content, and lastly the relationship between the repose angle and grain grading was studied by piling up coal gangue with different mix proportion. The result indicates that there is a wider range of grain size in the upper part of coal gangue heap, and the representative grain grading is well graded and easy to be compacted as filling materials. Besides, the wavy relationship curve of repose angle and coarse grain content shows that the content of 70% is the inflection point of ascent stage and 85% the inflection point of descent stage of the repose angle.

The first phase of LBMSF is responsible for balancing the incoming traffic into uniform cells while the second phase is in charge of self-routing the cells to their final destinations. In order to improve the throughput, LB-MSF is combined with the merits of erasure codes against packet loss. Experiments and analyses verify that the proposed fabric is able to achieve high-speed multicast switching and suitable for building super large-scale switching fabric in Next Generation Network(NGN) with all the advantages mentioned above. Furthermore, a prototype of the proposed switch is developed on FPGA, and presents excellent performance.", "keywords": ["Erasure codes", "Load-balanced", "Multicast switching"], "venue": "IEICE Transactions on Communications", "year": 2015, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309bd9d5"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Li Ma", "org": "School of Management, Hebei United University"}, {"name": "Yihong Ru", "org": "School of Economics and Management, Beijing Jiaotong University"}, {"name": "Qi Zhang", "org": "School of Economics and Management, Beijing Jiaotong University"}], "title": "The assessment study of entered biological agents circulation based on supply chain risk conduction model", "abstract": "As the rapid development of global biochemical industry, biological agents which situate on the highest level play a significant role in biological science research.

Compared with the control, CW, CS, CH, and CM reduced annual runoff by 9%, 13%, 25%, and 30%, sediment yield by 77%, 55%, 71%, and 28%, N loss by 10%, 23% 36%, and 37%, and P loss by 39%, 31%, 27%, and 25%, respectively.

However, over the long-term, surface soil nutrient accumulation in CW, CS, and CH diminished the benefit of those methods in reducing N and P losses.

Thus a study was initiated to explore possible differences and correlation of ALDH1 and TGF\u03b22 expression in the most common malignant and benign tumors of the breast in Chinese women. Samples of 75 breast cancer tissues, 30 paracancerous normal tissues, and 39 fibroadenoma breast tissues were investigated for the expression of ALDH1 and TGF\u03b22 using immunohistochemistry.

Mutations in the lineage of cells leading to the sperm or eggs are of particular importance because many such mutations may be shared by somatic tissues and also may be inherited, thus having a lasting consequence. For decades, little has been known about the pattern of the mutation rates along the germline development. Recently it was shown from a small portion of data that resulted from a large-scale mutation screening experiment that the rates of recessive lethal or nearly lethal mutations differ dramatically during the germline development of Drosophila melanogaster males. In this paper the full data set from the experiment and its analysis are reported by taking advantage of a recent methodologic advance. By analyzing the mutation patterns with different levels of recessive lethality, earlier published conclusions based on partial data are found to remain valid. Furthermore, it is found that for most nearly lethal mutations, the mutation rate at the first cell division is even greater than previous thought compared with those at other divisions. There is also some evidence that the mutation rate at the second division decreases rapidly but is still appreciably greater than those for the rest of the cleavage stage. The mutation rate at spermatogenesis is greater than late cleavage and stem-cell stages, but there is no evidence that rates are different among the five cell divisions of the spermatogenesis. We also found that a modestly biased sampling, leading to slightly more primordial germ cells after the eighth division than those reported in the literature, provides the best fit to the data. These findings provide conceptual and numerical basis for exploring the consequences of differential mutation rates during individual development. \u00a9 2014 Gao et al.", "keywords": ["Cell coalescent", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Germline mutation rate", "Likelihood inference"], "venue": "G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics", "year": 2014, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309b03be"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Mei Shen", "org": "Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University"}, {"name": "Min Yu", "org": "Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University"}, {"name": "Shi-qin Che", "org": "Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University"}, {"name": "Ke-xin Jin", "org": "Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University"}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": "Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University"}, {"name": "Ping Wang", "org": "Zhongshan Hospital of Dalian University"}], "title": "Effects of exercise training on bradykinin expression in rats with myocardial infarction", "abstract": "Background: Exercise can elicit generation of coronary collateral circulation through numerous pro-angiogenic growth factors. It is not enough via a single factor to clearly definite signaling pathways for the generation of collateral circulation. Many pro-angiogenic growth factors are involved in kallikrein-kinin system, and there is no report about exercise effects on this system. Objective: To study effects of exercise training on bradykinin expression in rats with myocardial infarction. Methods: Thirty Wistar rats were randomly assigned to control group, myocardial infarction group and exercises training group. Rats in the control group were subjected to thoracotomy with no coronary artery ligation. Rats in the other two groups were modeled. In the exercise training group, 3 days after myocardial infarction, rats were subjected to 30-minute exercise training on treadmill, once a day for 4 weeks. At the terminal of the experiment, blood samples were obtained to analyze bradykinin expression by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and the myocardium was sampled to analyze relative blood flow by microsphere method. Results And Conclusion: After exercise training, bradykinin level in the exercise training group was significantly higher than that in the myocardial infarction group (P < 0.001). At the end of experiment, the relative blood flows of the exercise training and myocardial infarction groups were both increased compared with before experiment (P < 0.05, P < 0.001). At the end of experiment, the relative blood flow of the exercise training group was significantly higher than that of the myocardial infarction group (P < 0.01).

To edge matching algorithm, target's displacement in two successive frames is determined by optimal matching of current unoccluded edge with real-time updated target template. For grayscale correlation matching based on multi-subblocks, the algorithm first estimates occluded region accurately by subblocks with distinct feature, and then tracks the target by residual unoccluded subblocks to participate in grayscale correlation matching.

Cordycepin with proven immunomodulatory, antitumor, and hepatoprotective properties is the main active metabolite of C militaris. Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases in which the body is unable to regulate blood sugar levels. Hence, we hypothesized that cordycepin can normalize blood sugar levels and improve the indicators of diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible effects of cordycepin from C militaris on diabetes in an alloxan-induced diabetic mouse model. Diabetic mice were intraperitoneally administered different doses of cordycepin (8, 24, and 72. mg/kg body weight) daily for 21. days. Acute toxicity test on normal mice was carried out by giving them maximum tolerance dose of cordycepin (3600. mg/kg) daily. A 47% reduction of the blood glucose level, 214% increase of hepatic glycogen content, and significant improvement of oral glucose tolerance were noticed after the effective dose of cordycepin was administered. Polyphagia and polydipsia, the typical symptoms of diabetes, were partly alleviated. Moreover, cordycepin offered protective effects against diabetes-related kidney and spleen injury. Maximum tolerance dose test indicated that cordycepin at the large dose of 3600. mg/kg did not show significant effect on body weight and major organ in normal mice after intraperitoneal administration for 14. days. The results showed that cordycepin from C militaris that elicited hypoglycemic activity contributes to the regulation of glucose metabolism in liver in alloxan-induced diabetic mice.

This defect appears to be remedied by treatment with interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) -based antiviral therapies; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying mDC dysfunction in HCV infection and restoration by IFN-\u03b1 treatment are unclear. The ubiquitin-editing protein A20 plays a crucial role in controlling the maturation, cytokine production and immunostimulatory function of mDCs. We propose that the expression of A20 correlates with the function of mDCs during HCV infection and IFN-\u03b1 therapy. In this study, we observed that A20 expression in mDCs isolated from chronically HCV-infected subjects was significantly higher than healthy subjects or subjects achieving sustained virological responses (SVR) following antiviral treatment. Notably, A20 expression in mDCs from HCV patients during IFN-\u03b1 treatment was significantly lower than for untreated patients, SVR patients, or healthy subjects. Besides, A20 expression in mDCs stimulated by polyI:C differed between HCV patients and healthy subjects, and this difference could be abrogated by the treatment with IFN-\u03b1 in vitro. Additionally, A20 expression by polyI:C-activated mDCs, with or without IFN-\u03b1 treatment, negatively correlated with the expression of HLA-DR, CD86 and CCR7, and the secretion of interleukin-12 (IL-12), but positively associated with the production of IL-10.

Here we discovered a novel biological function of p50 as a regulator of oncogenic c-Myc protein degradation upon arsenite treatment in a NF-\u03baB transcriptional-independent mechanism. Our results found that p50 was crucial for c-Myc protein induction following arsenite treatment by using specific knockdown and deletion of p50 in its normal expressed cells as well as reconstituting expression of p50 in its deficient cells. Subsequently we showed that p50 upregulated c-Myc protein expression mainly through inhibiting its degradation. We also identified that p50 exhibited this novel property by suppression of FBW7 expression. FBW7 was profoundly upregulated in p50-defecient cells in comparison to that in p50 intact cells, whereas knockdown of FBW7 in p50-/-cells restored arsenite-induced c-Myc protein accumulation, assuring that FBW7 up-regulation was responsible for defect of c-Myc protein expression in p50-/-cells.

Subsequently, Tobit model is applied to analyze factors influencing fertilizer use efficiency. The average technical efficiency and fertilizer use efficiency in this area in 2008 were 84.2% and 25.4% respectively.

Environmental awareness on water pollution and on the effect of fertilizers, off-farm income and a positive risk attitude have a significant positive effect on fertilizer use efficiency in Taihu Basin. Possessing a car or truck, labor intensity and the occurrence of disasters, on the other hand, have a significant negative effect on fertilizer use efficiency.

Clinical Relevance To identify genetic biomarkers that are potentially useful for genetic diagnosis of PCV and for differentiating PCV from nAMD. Methods We performed a literature search in EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, and the Chinese Biomedical Database for PCV genetic studies published before February 6, 2015. We then conducted a meta-analysis of all polymorphisms that had sufficient genotype/allele data reported in \u22652 studies and estimated the summary odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for PCV. We also compared the association profiles between PCV and nAMD, and performed a sensitivity analysis. Results A total of 66 studies were included in the meta-analysis, involving 56 polymorphisms in 19 genes/loci. In total, 31 polymorphisms in 10 genes/loci (age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 [ARMS2], high-temperature requirement factor A1 [HTRA1], complement factor H [CFH], complement component 2 [C2], CFB, RDBP, SKIV2L, CETP, 8p21, and 4q12) were significantly associated with PCV. Another 25 polymorphisms in 13 genes (ARMS2, HTRA1, C2, CFB, ELN, LIPC, LPL, ABCA1, VEGF-A, TLR3, LOXL1, SERPING1, and PEDF) had no significant association. Twelve polymorphisms at the ARMS2-HTRA1 locus showed significant differences between PCV and nAMD. The sensitivity analysis validated the significance of our analysis. Conclusions This study revealed 31 polymorphisms in 10 genes/loci that contribute to PCV susceptibility. Among them, ARMS2-HTRA1 also showed allelic diversity between PCV and nAMD.

Although CYP-sb21 was previously identified to be responsible for CsA-specific hydroxylation in vivo, the in vitro activity of CYP-sb21 has yet to be established for a deeper understanding of this P450 enzyme and further reaction optimization. In this study, we reconstituted the in vitro activity of CYP-sb21 by using surrogate redox partner proteins of bacterial and cyanobacterial origins. The highest CsA site-specific hydroxylation activity by CYP-sb21 was observed when it was partnered with the cyanobacterial redox system composed of seFdx and seFdR from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. The best bioconversion yields were obtained in the presence of 10% methanol as a cosolvent and an NADPH regeneration system.

Additionally, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was analyzed after pEGFP-Mfn2 was transfected into MCF-7 cells.

Following extensive, stringent, and X-specific quality control, XWAS offers an array of statistical tests of association, including: 1) the standard test between a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) and disease risk, including after first stratifying individuals by sex, 2) a test for a differential effect of a SNP on disease between males and females, 3) motivated by X-inactivation, a test for higher variance of a trait in heterozygous females as compared with homozygous females, and 4) for all tests, a version that allows for combining evidence from all SNPs across a gene. We applied the toolset analysis pipeline to 16 GWAS datasets of immune-related disorders and 7 risk factors of coronary artery disease, and discovered several new X-linked genetic associations.

The coding region of SH4 has been well studied regarding its function and roles in evolution. However, its promoter has not been identified, which limited our understanding of the detailed regulatory mechanisms of this gene. It is therefore critical to characterize the promoter and study its expression pattern. Results: We analyzed the 5\u2032 upstream sequences of this gene and identified a ~2.6 kb fragment with typical promoter features, which was designated as pSH4. The promoter contained a number of cis-acting elements related to abscisic acid (ABA) and a CpG island that were characteristics of multiple tissue-specific expression. We isolated and ligated pSH4 to the \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, and transformed it into a japonica rice cultivar to determine the multiple expression pattern of SH4. Histochemical location and fluorescence analyses of GUS activity of transgenic plants indicated multiple tissue-specific expression of pSH4 in the seed-pedicel junction region of mature panicles (with highest level), stems, coleoptiles of germinated seeds, and scutella of mature seeds. Conclusions: The multiple tissue-specific expression pSH4 is categorized as a spatiotemporal promoter that drives the expression of the SH4 gene in different rice tissues, in addition to the seed-pedicel junction region.

Meanwhile, Metropolis criterion and noise reduction mechanism are introduced to AFSA for enhancing the convergence rate and antinoise ability. The artificial grid graph and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are used in the experiments, and the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has stronger antinoise ability and higher precision. A number of evaluation indicators also demonstrate that the effect of HAFSA is more excellent than FCM and suppressed FCM (SFCM).", "keywords": [""], "venue": "Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine", "year": 2015, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309ae90a"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiaowen Zhong", "org": ""}, {"name": "Yang Li", "org": ""}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": ""}, {"name": "Suohai Fan", "org": ""}], "title": "Cooperative behavior in N-person evolutionary snowdrift game on Barab\u00e1si-Albert network with link rewiring mechanism", "abstract": "Based on scale-free Barab\u00e1si-Albert (BA) network, we introduce the link rewiring mechanism to study the cooperation in the N-person Evolutionary Snowdrift Game (NESG).

Materials and Methods: Serum CEA, CYFRA21-1 and CA125 were assessed in 140 patients with NSCLC, 90 patients with benign lung disease and 90 normal control subjects, and differences of expression were compared in each group, and joint effects of these tumor markers in the diagnosis of NSCLC were analyzed. Results: Serum CEA, CYFRA21-1 and CA125 in patients with NSCLC were significantly higher than those with benign lung disease and normal controls (P < 0.05). The sensitivity of CEA, CYFRA21-1 and CA125 were 49.45%, 59.67%, and 44.87% respectively. As expected, combinations of these tumor markers improved their sensitivity for NSCLC. The combined detection of CEA + CYFRA21-1 was the most cost-effective combination which had higher sensitivity and specificity in NSCLC. Elevation of serum CEA and CYFRA21-1 was significantly associated with pathological types (P < 0.05) and elevation of serum CEA, CYFRA21-1 and CA125 was significantly associated with TNM staging (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Single measurement of CEA, CYFRA21-1 and CA125 is of diagnostic value in the diagnosis of lung cancer, and a joint detection of these three tumor markers, could greatly improve the sensitivity of diagnosis on NSCLC.

Although a few immune genes have been shown to regulate social and emotional behaviors, how immune gene network(s) may jointly regulate sociability has not been investigated so far. Methods: To decipher the potential immune-mediated mechanisms underlying social behavior, we first studied the brain microarray data of eight inbred mouse strains with known variations in social behavior and retrieved the differentially expressed immune genes. We then made a protein-protein interaction analysis of them to find the major networks and explored the potential association of these genes with the behavior and brain morphology in the mouse phenome database. To validate the expression and function of the candidate immune genes, we selected the C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains among the eight inbred strains, compared their social behaviors in resident-intruder and 3-chambered social tests and the mRNA levels of these genes, and analyzed the correlations of these genes with the social behaviors. Results: A group of immune genes were differentially expressed in the brains of these mouse strains. The representative C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains displayed significant differences in social behaviors, DBA/2J mice being less active in social dominance and social interaction than C57BL/6J mice. The mRNA levels of H2-d1 in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus and C1qb in the hippocampus of the DBA/2J strain were significantly down-regulated as compared to those in the C57BL/6J strain. In contrast, Polr3b in the hippocampus and Tnfsf13b in the prefrontal cortex of the DBA/2J strain were up-regulated.

The patients selected were 60 autistic children with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status \u2160, who were aged between two and 12 years and scheduled for stem cell transplantation. The children received an inhalation induction of 8% sevoflurane, followed by intravenous injection of etomidate (0.2 mg/kg) in group E and propofol (2 mg/kg) in group P (n=30/group). Supplemental doses of 0.1 mg/kg etomidate or 1 mg/kg propofol were used until a deep sedation was obtained. The heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, Ramsay sedation score (RSS) and recovery time were monitored continuously. Following anesthesia, blood pressure and HR measurements were significantly decreased in group P compared with the baseline (P<0.01) and group E values at the same time\u2011points (P<0.05). The occurrence of adverse effects, such as respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension and pain on injection, was significantly higher in group P than that in group E, whereas the incidence of myoclonus in group E was significantly higher than that in group P (P<0.01). No significant differences in anesthesia induction, surgery duration, recovery time, RSS and physician satisfaction were observed between the two groups. In conclusion, sevoflurane\u2011etomidate combinations resulted in more stable hemodynamic responses and relatively fewer adverse effects compared with propofol injection following sevoflurane inhalation and may therefore be more suitable for the induction of short\u2011term anesthesia in autistic children during stem cell transplantation.", "keywords": ["Autism", "Etomidate", "Propofol", "Sevoflurane", "Stem cell transplantation"], "venue": "Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine", "year": 2015, "id": "5bc6bfdd486cef66309b06a0"}, {"authors": [{"name": "Xiaobin Ma", "org": ""}, {"name": "Huafeng Kang", "org": ""}, {"name": "Zhijun Dai", "org": ""}, {"name": "Li Ma", "org": ""}, {"name": "Yaofeng Jin", "org": ""}, {"name": "Xijing Wang", "org": ""}], "title": "Impact of the IGFBP3 A-202C polymorphism on susceptibility and clinicopathologic features of breast cancer", "abstract": "Background: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) plays an important role in cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and mammary carcinogenesis. Genetic variations in IGFBP3 have been identified to influence the circulating IGFBP3 level. The present study determined the impact of an important promoter polymorphism (A-202C, rs2854744) on susceptibility and progression of breast cancer in a Chinese population. Methods: We genotyped the IGFBP3 A-202C polymorphism in a case-control study involving 465 breast cancer patients and 799 age-matched, cancer-free controls using the TaqMan method. Logistic regression was used to assess the genetic association between the occurrence and progression of breast cancer. Results: Compared with the wild genotype (-202AA), we found a statistically significant increased risk of breast cancer associated with the variant genotypes (CC vs. AA: OR. = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.25-3.21; AC. +.

In this study, we synthesized a novel N-hydroxyacrylamide-derived HDAC inhibitor, I-7ab, and examined its antitumor activity. Our investigations demonstrated that I-7ab exerted cytotoxicity toward and inhibited the growth of human cancer cell lines at micromolar concentrations. Among tested cells, HCT116 was the most sensitive one to the treatment of I-7ab. However, I-7ab displayed far less cytotoxicity in human normal cells. In HCT116 cells, I-7ab inhibited the expression of class I HDACs, especially that of HDAC3, and suppressed EGFR signaling pathway. With respect to the cytotoxic effect of I-7ab, it induced apoptosis via increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and suppressing the translocation of NF-\u03baB. Other than inducing apoptosis, I-7ab inhibited the expression of cyclin B1 and thereby arrests cell cycle progression at G2/M phase.

The duration D (in h) and the average rainfall intensity I (in mm/h) that triggered the debris flows were determined for 252 of these events in order to analyze the spatial features of rainfall thresholds.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether MsrA with PEP-1, a cell penetrating peptide, fused to its N-terminus can protect against oxidative stress in macrophages and can attenuate atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E deficient (apoE<sup>-/-</sup>) mice. Methods: MsrA and the fusion protein PEP-1-MsrA were expressed and purified using a pET28a expression system. Transduction of the fusion protein into macrophages was confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis levels were measured by flow cytometry. In in vivo study, MsrA or PEP-1-MsrA proteins were intraperitoneally injected into apoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice fed a Western diet for 12weeks. Plasma lipids levels, inflammatory gene expression, and paraoxonase-1 (PON1) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were assessed. Atherosclerotic lesions were analyzed by Oil Red O staining and immunohistochemistry. Results: PEP-1-MsrA could penetrate the cells and significantly reduced intracellular ROS levels and apoptosis in H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>-treated macrophages.

In in vivo study, PEP-1-MsrA injection significantly increased plasma PON1 and SOD activities and decreased plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) level compared to the injection of vehicle control or MsrA. In PEP-1-MsrA injected mice, hepatic PON1 levels were increased, while the expression of TNFa\u03b1 and IL-6 mRNA in the liver was suppressed. Although plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride levels did not change, the aortic atherosclerosis in PEP-1-MsrA treated mice was significantly reduced.

The experiment included four treatments: added N (+N, 20gm<sup>-2</sup>) with the litter removed (LR),+N with the litter left intact (LI), LI without N addition (-N), and LR with-N. Soil samples were collected at depths of 0-10 and 10-20cm, and the following parameters were measured: 1) aboveground biomass (AGB) and litter biomass and 2) microbial community composition and content. Overall, the AGB and litter biomass significantly increased by 45.85% and 50.42% in response to N addition, whereas litter removal increased the AGB by 52.96%.

In breast tumors, aberrant DNA methylation is a prevalent epigenetic feature associated with increased risk of metastasis and poor prognosis. However, the mechanism by which hypoxia alters DNA methylation or other epigenetic controls that promote breast malignancy remains poorly understood. We discovered that hypoxia deregulates TET1 and TET3, the enzymes that catalyze conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5hmC), thereby leading to breast tumor-initiating cell (BTIC) properties. TET1/3 and 5hmC levels were closely associated with tumor hypoxia, tumor malignancy, and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Mechanistic investigations showed that hypoxia leads to genome-wide changes in DNA hydroxymethylation associated with upregulation of TNF\u03b1 expression and activation of its downstream p38-MAPK effector pathway. Coordinate functions of TET1 and TET3 were also required to activate TNF\u03b1-p38-MAPK signaling as a response to hypoxia.

Chronic instead of acute SDG treatment (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg, p.o., twice per day for three weeks) ameliorated thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in diabetic mice, and these analgesic actions persisted about three days when SDG treatment was terminated. Although chronic treatment of SDG to diabetic mice did not impact on the symptom of hyperglycemia, it greatly attenuated excessive oxidative stress in sciatic nerve and spinal cord tissues, and partially counteracted the condition of weight decrease. Furthermore, the analgesic actions of SDG were abolished by co-treatment with the reactive oxygen species donor tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH), but potentiated by the reactive oxygen species scavenger phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN).
